1 Describing movement  
Chapter 1: Our eyes are good at detecting movement. We notice  
even quite small movements out of the corners of  
our eyes. It’s important for us to be able to judge  
Kinematics –  
movement – think about crossing the road, cycling or  
driving, or catching a ball.  
describing motion Figure 1.1 shows a way in which movement can  
be recorded on a photograph. This is a stroboscopic  
photograph of a boy juggling three balls. As he juggles,  
a bright lamp flashes several times a second so that  
the camera records the positions of the balls at equal  
Learning outcomes intervals of time.  
If we knew the time between flashes, we could Figure 1.1 This boy is juggling three balls. A stroboscopic  
You should be able to: measure the photograph and calculate the speed of a lamp flashes at regular intervals; the camera is moved to one  
ball as it moves through the air. side at a steady rate to show separate images of the boy.  
■ define displacement, speed and velocity  
■ draw and interpret displacement–time graphs  
■ describe laboratory methods for determining speed  
■ use vector addition to add two or more vectors Speed  
We can calculate the average speed of something moving if If you look at the speedometer in a car, it doesn’t  
we know the distance it moves and the time it takes: tell you the car’s average speed; rather, it tells you its

Describing movement  
Our eyes are good at detecting movement. We notice  
even quite small movements out of the corners of  
our eyes. It’s important for us to be able to judge  
movement – think about crossing the road, cycling or  
driving, or catching a ball.  
Figure 1.1 shows a way in which movement can  
be recorded on a photograph. This is a stroboscopic  
photograph of a boy juggling three balls. As he juggles,  
a bright lamp flashes several times a second so that  
the camera records the positions of the balls at equal  
intervals of time.  
If we knew the time between flashes, we could

Step 1 It is helpful to start by writing down what you

v = 15 m s−1 quantity by another when you should have multiplied  
them. The units of an equation must be balanced, just as the

For example, how far does a spacecraft travelling at  
d = v × t 40 000 km h−1 travel in one day? Since there are 24 hours in

= 5.4 × 104 m distance travelled = 40 000 km h−1 × 24 h  
= 54 km  
= 960 000 km  
The car will travel 54 km in 1 hour.

The cheetah (Figure 2.1) has a maximum speed of over

a long straight road it can easily travel faster than a

Measurements using a motion sensor  
The computer software which handles the data  
provided by the motion sensor can calculate the  
acceleration of a trolley. However, because it deduces  
velocity from measurements of position, and then  
calculates acceleration from values of velocity, its  
precision is relatively poor.

acceleration of 20 m s−2. Calculate its velocity after 50 s. v2 = 64 + 36 = 100 m2 s−2

a = 20 m s−2  
So the car will be travelling at 10 m s−1 when it stops  
t = 50 s  
accelerating.  
and what we want to know: v = ?  
(You may find it easier to carry out these calculations  
Step 2 The equation linking u, a, t and v is equation 1: without including the units of quantities when you  
v = u + at substitute in the equation. However, including the units  
can help to ensure that you end up with the correct units  
Substituting gives:  
for the final answer.)  
v = 0 + (20 × 50)  
6 A train (Figure 2.14) travelling at 20 m s−1 accelerates at  
Step 3 Calculation then gives: 0.50 m s−2 for 30 s. Calculate the distance travelled by the  
v = 1000 m s−1 train in this time.  
So the rocket will be travelling at 1000 m s−1 after 50 s.  
This makes sense, since its velocity increases by 20 m s−1  
every second, for 50 s. u = 20 m s–1  
You could use the same equation to work out how long  
the rocket would take to reach a velocity of 2000 m s−1,  
or the acceleration it must have to reach a speed of  
1000 m s−1 in 40 s, and so on.

road at 8.0 m s−1. It accelerates at 1.0 m s−2 for a distance  
of 18 m. How fast is it then travelling?  
Step 1 What we know: u = 20 m s−1  
t = 30 s  
a = 0.50 m s−2  
u = 8.0 m s–1 v = ?  
and what we want to know: s = ?  
Step 2 The equation we need is equation 3:  
s = 18 m s = ut + 1at2  
2  
Figure 2.13 For Worked example 5. This car accelerates Substituting gives:  
for a short distance as it travels along the road. s = (20 × 30) + 1 × 0.5 × (30)2  
2  
Step 3 Calculation then gives:  
In this case, we will have to use a different equation,  
s = 600 + 225 = 825 m  
because we know the distance during which the car  
accelerates, not the time. So the train will travel 825 m while it is accelerating.  
Step 1 What we know: u = 8.0 m s−1  
a = 1.0 m s−2  
s = 18 m  
and what we want to know: v = ?  
Step 2 The equation we need is equation 4:  
v2 = u2 + 2as  
Substituting gives:  
v2 = 8.02 + (2 × 1.0 × 18)

Figure 2.21 shows that this is not the case. There are easier methods for finding g which can be used  
If we measure the acceleration of a freely falling object in the laboratory. These are described in Box 2.2.  
on the surface of the Earth, we find a value of about  
9.81 m s−2. This is known as the acceleration of free fall,  
and is given the symbol g:  
acceleration of free fall, g = 9.81 m s−2  
The value of g depends on where you are on the Earth’s  
surface, but we usually take g = 9.81 m s−2.  
If we drop an object, its initial velocity u = 0. How far  
will it fall in time t? Substituting in s = ut + 1

= 4.9 × t2  
Hence, by timing a falling object, we can determine g. Figure 2.22 A bungee-jumper falls with initial acceleration g.

Measuring g using an electronic timer h / m t / s t2 / s2  
In this method, a steel ball-bearing is held by an 0.27 0.25 0.063  
electromagnet (Figure 2.23). When the current to the

an electronic timer starts. The ball falls through a

trapdoor, and this breaks a circuit to stop the timer.

It is important to use a consistent sign convention  
here. We will take upwards as positive, and downwards as  
negative. So the stone’s initial velocity is positive, but its  
acceleration g is negative. We can solve various problems  
about the stone’s motion by using the equations of motion.

How high?  
How high will the stone rise above ground level of the cliff?  
As the stone rises upwards, it moves more and more  
slowly – it decelerates, because of the force of gravity. At its  
highest point, the stone’s velocity is zero. So the quantities

1 A motorway designer can assume that cars approaching a motorway enter a slip road with a velocity
of 10 m s−1 and reach a velocity of 30 m s−1 before joining the motorway. Calculate the minimum
length for the slip road, assuming that vehicles have an acceleration of 4.0 m s−2. [4]
2 A train is travelling at 50 m s−1 when the driver applies the brakes and gives the train a constant deceleration
of magnitude 0.50 m s−2 for 100 s. Describe what happens to the train. Calculate the distance travelled
by the train in 100 s. [7]
3 A boy stands on a cliff edge and throws a stone vertically upwards at time t = 0. The stone leaves his
hand at 20 m s−1. Take the acceleration of the ball as 9.81 m s−2.
a Show that the equation for the displacement of the ball is:
s = 20t − 4.9t2 [2]
b What is the height of the stone 2.0 s aft er release and 6.0 s aft er release? [3]
c When does the stone return to the level of the boy’s hand? Assume the boy’s hand does not move
vertically aft er the ball is released. [4] |  |

4 The graph in Figure 2.33 shows the variation of velocity  
with time of two cars, A and B, which are travelling in  
the same direction over a period of time of 40 s. Car A,  
travelling at a constant velocity of 40 m s−1, overtakes  
car B at time t = 0. In order to catch up with car A, car B  
immediately accelerates uniformly for 20 s to reach a  
constant velocity of 50 m s−1. Calculate:  
a how far A travels during the first 20 s [2]  
b the acceleration and distance of travel of B during the first 20 s [5]  
c the additional time taken for B to catch up with A [2]  
d the distance each car will have then travelled since t = 0. [2]  
5 An athlete competing in the long jump leaves the ground with a velocity of 5.6 m s−1 at an angle of 30°  
to the horizontal.  
a Determine the vertical component of the velocity and use this value to find the time between leaving  
the ground and landing. [2]  
b Determine the horizontal component of the velocity and use this value to find the horizontal  
distance travelled. [4]  
6 Figure 2.34 shows an arrangement used to measure the acceleration of a metal plate as it falls vertically.  
The metal plate is released from rest and falls a distance of 0.200 m before breaking light beam 1. It then  
falls a further 0.250 m before breaking light beam 2.

a Calculate the time taken for the plate to fall 0.200 m from rest. (You may assume that the metal plate  
falls with an acceleration equal to the acceleration of free fall.) [2]  
b The timer measures the speed of the metal plate as it falls through each light beam. The speed as it  
falls through light beam 1 is 1.92 m s−1 and the speed as it falls through light beam 2 is 2.91 m s−1.  
i Calculate the acceleration of the plate between the two light beams. [2]  
ii State and explain one reason why the acceleration of the plate is not equal to the acceleration  
of free fall. [2]

the road ahead. He immediately brakes hard but travels a distance of 60 m at speed v before the brakes
are applied. The skid marks left on the road by the wheels of the car are of length 140 m (Figure 2.37).
The police investigate whether the driver was speeding and establish that the car decelerates at 2.0 m s−2

Force and acceleration  
If you have ever flown in an aeroplane you will know  
how the back of the seat pushes you forwards when  
the aeroplane accelerates down the runway (Figure  
3.1). The pilot must control many forces on the  
aeroplane to ensure a successful take-off.  
In Chapters 1 and 2 we saw how motion can  
be described in terms of displacement, velocity,  
acceleration and so on. This is known as kinematics.  
Now we are going to look at how we can explain how  
an object moves in terms of the forces which change  
its motion. This is known as dynamics.  
Figure 3.1 An aircraft takes off – the force provided by the  
engines causes the aircraft to accelerate.  
Calculating the acceleration  
Figure 3.2a shows how we represent the force which In this example we have F = 20 000 N and m = 10 000 kg,

by a force depends on the mass of the object. The mass of  
an object is a measure of its inertia, or its ability to resist  
any change in its motion. The greater the mass, the smaller  
the acceleration which results. If you push your hardest  
against a small car (which has a small mass), you will have  
a greater effect than if you push against a more massive mass m = 700 kg mass m = 2600 kg  
car (Figure 3.3). So, for a constant force, the acceleration is  
inversely proportional to the mass: Figure 3.3 It is easier to make a small mass accelerate than a  
large mass.

the push of your foot. Without the force, the moving object  
comes to a halt. So what conclusion might we draw?  
A moving object needs a force to keep it moving.  
Th is might seem a sensible conclusion to draw, but it is  
wrong. We have not thought about all the forces involved.

this had been handed down from the time of the ancient  
Greek philosopher Aristotle. So it was a great achievement  
when scientists were able to develop a picture of a world

You can observe the effect of drag on a falling object if  
you drop a key or a coin into the deep end of a swimming  
pool. For the first few centimetres, it speeds up, but for the  
remainder of its fall, it has a steady speed. (If it fell through  
the same distance in air, it would accelerate all the way.)  
The drag of water means that the falling object reaches its  
terminal velocity very soon after it is released. Compare

this with a skydiver, who has to fall hundreds of metres  
before reaching terminal velocity.  
Moving through air  
We rarely experience drag in air. This is because air is  
much less dense than water; its density is roughly 1 that  
800  
of water. At typical walking speed, we do not notice the  
effects of drag. However, if you want to move faster, they  
can be important. Racing cyclists, like the one shown in

The idea of a parachute is to greatly increase the air

parachutist can land safely. Figure 3.10 shows how a  
parachutist’s velocity might change during descent.

Identifying forces  
It is important to be able to identify the forces which act on an object. When we  
know what forces are acting, we can predict how it will move. Figure 3.14 shows  
some important forces, how they arise, and how we represent them in diagrams.

The two gravitational forces are a Newton’s third law pair,  
as are the two contact forces. Don’t be misled into thinking  
that the person’s weight and the contact force of the floor  
are a Newton’s third law pair. Although they are ‘equal and

not of the same type.

Force is a vector quantity. Sailors know a lot about the  
vector nature of forces. For example, they can sail ‘into  
the wind’. The sails of a yacht can be angled to provide  
a component of force in the forward direction and  
the boat can then sail at almost 45º to the wind. The  
boat tends to ‘heel over’ and the crew sit on the side  
of the boat to provide a turning eff ect in the opposite  
direction (Figure 4.1).

Does the contact force N help to accelerate the trolley  
down the ramp? To answer this, we must calculate its  
component down the slope. The angle between N and the  
slope is 90°. So:  
component of N down the slope = N cos 90° = 0  
The cosine of 90° is zero, and so N has no component  
down the slope. This shows why it is useful to think in  
terms of the components of forces; we don’t know the  
value of N, but, since it has no effect down the slope, we  
can ignore it.  
(There’s no surprise about this result. The trolley runs  
down the slope because of the influence of its weight, not  
because it is pushed by the contact force N.)  
Changing the slope  
If the students in Figure 4.9 increase the slope of their

this from Figure 4.10.)

The centre of gravity of an object is defined as the point  
where all the weight of the object may be considered irregular object

The object will stop swinging when its centre of

The turning effect of a force  
Forces can make things accelerate. They can do something  
else as well: they can make an object turn round. We say  
that they can have a turning effect. Figure 4.16 shows how

Figure 4.17b shows a slightly more complicated  
situation. F is pushing at an angle θ to the lever, rather

than at 90°. This makes it have less turning effect. There  
are two ways to calculate the moment of the force.  
Method 1  
Draw a perpendicular line from the pivot to the line of the  
force. Find the distance x . Calculate the moment of the

force, F × x . From the right-angled triangle, we can see  
2 2  
that:  
x = d sin θ

Hence:  
moment of force = F × d sin θ = F d sin θ

The moment of a force is defined as follows:  
problems, it is often most convenient to take moments  
about the pivot as there is often an unknown force acting

Calculating work done  
Because doing work defines what we mean by energy,

the force F and the distance s moved in the direction of

this, we will consider three examples involving gravity

### WORKED EXAMPLE

1 A man pulls a box along horizontal ground using a rope  
(Figure 5.7). The force provided by the rope is 200 N, at  
### 200 N

an angle of 30° to the horizontal. Calculate the work  
done if the box moves 5.0 m along the ground.  
30°  
Step 1 Calculate the component of the force in the  
direction in which the box moves. This is the horizontal  
component of the force:  
5.0 m  
horizontal component of force = 200 cos 30° ≈ 173 N  
Figure 5.7 For Worked example 1.  
Hint: F cos θ is the component of the force at an angle θ to  
the direction of motion.  
Hint: Note that we could have used the equation  
Step 2 Now calculate the work done: work done = Fs cos θ to combine the two steps into one.  
work done = force × distance moved = 173 × 5.0 = 865 J

Chapter 5: Work, energy and power  
Down, up, down – energy  
changes  
When an object falls, it speeds up. Its g.p.e. decreases  
and its k.e. increases. Energy is being transformed from  
gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy. Some energy  
is likely to be lost, usually as heat because of air resistance.  
However, if no energy is lost in the process, we have:  
decrease in g.p.e. = gain in k.e.  
We can use this idea to solve a variety of problems, as  
illustrated by Worked example 4.  
### WORKED EXAMPLE

Figure 5.12 The roller-coaster car accelerates as it comes  
downhill. It’s even more exciting if it runs through water.  
4 A pendulum consists of a brass sphere of mass 5.0 kg  
As the car runs along the roller-coaster track (Figure hanging from a long string (see Figure 5.14). The  
sphere is pulled to the side so that it is 0.15 m above  
5.13), its energy changes.

1 At the top of the first hill, it has the most g.p.e.  
be moving when it passes through the lowest point  
2 As it runs downhill, its g.p.e. decreases and its k.e.  
along its path?  
increases.  
3 At the bottom of the hill, all of its g.p.e. has been  
changed to k.e. and heat and sound energy.  
4 As it runs back uphill, the force of gravity slows it  
down. k.e. is being changed to g.p.e. 77  
Inevitably, some energy is lost by the car. There is friction  
with the track, and air resistance. So the car cannot return  
to its original height. That is why the second hill must be  
slightly lower than the first. It is fun if the car runs through  
a trough of water, but that takes even more energy, and the  
0.15 m  
car cannot rise so high. There are many situations where v  
an object’s energy changes between gravitational potential  
energy and kinetic energy. For example: Figure 5.14 For Worked example 4.  
■■ a high diver falling towards the water – g.p.e. changes to k.e.  
■■ a ball is thrown upwards – k.e. changes to g.p.e.  
■■ a child on a swing – energy changes back and forth between  
g.p.e. and k.e.

Sometimes, applying the principle of conservation of  
energy can seem like a scientific fiddle. When physicists  
were investigating radioactive decay involving beta  
particles, they found that the particles after the decay had  
less energy in total than the particles before. They guessed  
that there was another, invisible particle which was  
carrying away the missing energy. This particle, named  
the neutrino, was proposed by the theoretical physicist  
Wolfgang Pauli in 1931. The neutrino was not detected by  
experimenters until 25 years later.  
Although we cannot prove that energy is always  
conserved, this example shows that the principle of  
conservation of energy can be a powerful tool in helping us  
to understand what is going on in nature, and that it can help  
us to make fruitful predictions about future experiments.

500 N since our muscles are not very efficient, they need to  
be supplied with energy even faster, perhaps at a rate  
of 1 kW. This is why we cannot run up stairs all day long  
without greatly increasing the amount we eat. The  
inefficiency of our muscles also explains why we get hot  
when we exert ourselves.

comes to a complete halt. The ‘motion’ of one trolley has  
been transferred to the other.  
You can see another interesting result if two moving  
identical trolleys collide head-on. If the collision is springy,  
both trolleys bounce backwards. If a fast-moving trolley  
collides with a slower one, the fast trolley bounces back at  
the speed of the slow one, and the slow one bounces back  
at the speed of the fast one. In this collision, it is as if the  
velocities of the trolleys have been swapped.

Figure 6.8 Two objects may collide in different ways: this is an  
elastic collision. An inelastic collision of the same two objects

is shown in Figure 6.9.  
You should be able to see that, in this collision, both  
momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Before  
the collision, object A of mass m is moving to the right  
at speed v and object B of mass m is moving to the left at  
speed v. Afterwards, we still have two masses m moving  
with speed v, but now object A is moving to the left and  
object B is moving to the right. We can express this  
mathematically as follows:

object B: mass = m velocity = −v momentum = −mv

Down to Earth  
If you push a large rock over a cliff, its speed increases as it  
falls. Where does its momentum come from? And when it  
lands, where does its momentum disappear to?  
The rock falls because of the pull of the Earth’s  
gravity on it. This force is its weight and it makes the  
rock accelerate towards the Earth. Its weight does work  
and the rock gains kinetic energy. It gains momentum  
downwards. Something must be gaining an equal amount  
of momentum in the opposite (upward) direction. It is  
the Earth, which starts to move upwards as the rock falls  
downwards. The mass of the Earth is so great that its  
change in velocity is small – far too small to be noticeable.  
When the rock hits the ground, its momentum  
becomes zero. At the same instant, the Earth also stops  
moving upwards. The rock’s momentum cancels out the  
Earth’s momentum. At all times during the rock’s fall and  
crash-landing, momentum has been conserved.  
If a rock of mass 60 kg is falling towards the Earth at a  
speed of 20 m s−1, how fast is the Earth moving towards it?  
Figure 6.13 shows the situation. The mass of the Earth is

Again, the answer is no. The chemicals have

of downwards momentum is given to the Earth. Of course,

Springy stuff  
In everyday life, we make great use of elastic  
materials. The term elastic means springy; that is, the  
material deforms when a force is applied and returns  
to its original shape when the force is removed. Rubber  
is an elastic material. This is obviously important for  
a bungee jumper (Figure 7.1). The bungee rope must  
have the correct degree of elasticity. The jumper must  
be brought gently to a halt. If the rope is too stiff, the  
jumper will be jerked violently so that the deceleration  
is greater than their body can withstand. On the other  
hand, if the rope is too stretchy, they may bounce up  
and down endlessly, or even strike the ground.  
In this chapter we will look at how forces can change  
the shape of an object. Before that, we will look at two  
important quantities, density and pressure.

Compressive and tensile forces  
A pair of forces is needed to change the shape of a spring.  
If the spring is being squashed and shortened, we say  
that the forces are compressive. More usually, we are  
concerned with stretching a spring, in which case the  
forces are described as tensile (Figure 7.4).

Chapter 7: Matter and materials  
If a spring or anything else responds to a pair of tensile  
forces in the way shown in section OA of Figure 7.7, we say  
that it obeys Hooke’s law:  
A material obeys Hooke’s law if the extension produced in  
it is proportional to the applied force (load).  
If you apply a small force to a spring and then release  
it, it will return to its original length. This behaviour is  
described as ‘elastic’. However, if you apply a large force,  
the spring may not return to its original length. It has  
become permanently deformed. The force beyond which  
the spring becomes permanently deformed is known as  
the elastic limit.

BOX 7.1: Investigating springs  
Springs can be combined in different ways  
(Figure 7.9): end-to-end (in series) and side-by-  
side (in parallel). Using identical springs, you can  
measure the force constant of a single spring, and of  
springs in series and in parallel. Before you do this,  
predict the outcome of such an experiment. If the  
force constant of a single spring is k, what will be the  
equivalent force constant of:  
■■ two springs in series?  
■■ two springs in parallel?  
This approach can be applied to combinations of  
three or more springs.  
QUESTION a b  
Figure 7.9 Two ways to combine a pair of springs:  
a in series; b in parallel.  
Why do we use a long wire? Obviously, this is because  
a short wire would not stretch as much as a long one. We  
need to take account of this in our calculations, and we  
do this by calculating the strain produced by the load.  
The strain is defined as the fractional increase in the

Note that both extension and original length must be  
in the same units, and so strain is a ratio, without units.  
Sometimes strain is given as a percentage. For example, a  
strain of 0.012 is equivalent to 1.2%.  
Why do we use a thin wire? This is because a thick  
wire would not stretch as much for the same force. Again,  
we need to take account of this in our calculations, and  
we do this by calculating the stress produced by the load.  
The stress is defined as the force applied per unit cross-

if you have ever used an exercise machine with springs  
intended to develop your muscles (Figure 7.14). Similarly,

you up into the air. 0

First, consider the linear region of the graph where  
Hooke’s law is obeyed, OA. The graph in this region is a

proportional to the applied force F. There are two ways to  
find the work done.

We can think about the average force needed to produce

Note that the elastic potential energy relates to the elastic

We can draw electric fields in much the same way that  
we can draw magnetic fields, by showing field lines  
(sometimes called lines of force). The three most important  
field shapes are shown in Figure 8.6.  
charged As with magnetic fields, this representation tells us two  
metal things about the field: its direction (from the direction of

lines). The arrows go from positive to negative; they tell us

a charged gold leaf to investigate a field, this illustrates the  
Electric field strength principle of testing the field with a charge.)

For an electric field, we define electric field strength E as  
follows:

It follows that the units of electric field strength are

The strength of a uniform field  
You can set up a uniform field between two parallel metal  
plates by connecting them to the terminals of a high-  
voltage power supply (Figure 8.11). The strength of the field  
between them depends on two factors:  
■■ the voltage V between the plates – the higher the voltage, – +  
the stronger the field: E ∝ V  
■■ the separation d between the plates – the greater their Figure 8.11 There is a uniform field between two parallel,

separation, the weaker the field: E ∝ charged plates.  
d  
These factors can be combined to give an equation for E:  
### V

E = − From this equation, we can see that we can write the units  
d  
of electric field strength as volts per metre (V m−1). Note:  
Worked example 1 shows a derivation of this. Note that the

minus sign is necessary because, in Figure 8.11, the voltage  
V increases towards the right while the force F acts in the Worked example 2 shows how to solve problems involving  
opposite direction, towards the left. E is a vector quantity. uniform fields.

### QUESTION

8 Air is usually a good insulator. However, a spark  
can jump through dry air when the electric field  
strength is greater than about 40 000 V cm−1. This is  
called electrical breakdown. The spark shows that  
electrical charge is passing through the air – a current  
is flowing. (Do not confuse this with a chemical spark  
such as you might see when watching fireworks; in  
that case, small particles of a chemical substance are  
burning quickly.)  
a A Van de Graaff generator (Figure 8.13) is able to  
make sparks jump across a 4 cm gap. What is the  
voltage produced by the generator?  
b The highest voltage reached by the live wire of a  
conventional mains supply is 325 V. In theory (but  
DO NOT try this), how close would you have to get  
to a live wire to get a shock from it? Figure 8.13 A Van de Graaff generator produces voltages  
sufficient to cause sparks in air.  
c Estimate the voltage of a thundercloud from which  
lightning strikes the ground 100 m below.

Conservation of energy Figure 10.15 Kirchhoff’s laws make it possible to  
deduce the ammeter readings.  
Kirchhoff’s second law is a consequence of the principle of  
conservation of energy. If a charge, say 1 C, moves around  
the circuit, it gains energy as it moves through each source  
of e.m.f. and loses energy as it passes through each p.d. If Resistor combinations

the charge moves all the way round the circuit, so that it  
ends up where it started, it must have the same energy at You are already familiar with the formulae used to  
the end as at the beginning. (Otherwise we would be able calculate the combined resistance R of two or more  
to create energy from nothing simply by moving charges resistors connected in series or in parallel. To derive these  
around circuits.) So: formulae we have to make use of Kirchhoff’s laws.

You should recall that an e.m.f. in volts is simply the  
series (Figure 10.16). According to Kirchhoff’s first law, the  
energy gained per 1 C of charge as it passes through a  
current in each resistor is the same. The p.d. V across the  
source. Similarly, a p.d. is the energy lost per 1 C as it  
combination is equal to the sum of the p.d.s across the

1 volt = 1 joule per coulomb  
### V = V + V

Hence we can think of Kirchhoff’s second law as:  
Since V = IR, V = IR and V = IR , we can write:

energy gained per coulomb around loop  
### IR = IR + IR

Chapter 11: Resistance and resistivity  
Superconductivity  
As metals are cooled, their resistance decreases. It was  
discovered as long ago as 1911 that when mercury was  
cooled using liquid helium to 4.1 K (4.1 degrees above  
absolute zero), its resistance suddenly fell to zero.  
This phenomenon was named superconductivity.  
Other metals, such as lead at 7.2 K, also become  
superconductors.  
When charge flows in a superconductor it can  
continue in that superconductor without the need  
for any potential difference and without dissipating  
any energy. This means that large currents can occur  
without the unwanted heating effect that would occur  
in a normal metallic or semiconducting conductor. Figure 11.1 The Japanese JR-Maglev train, capable of speeds

| Superconductivity
As metals are cooled, their resistance decreases. It was
discovered as long ago as 1911 that when mercury was
cooled using liquid helium to 4.1 K (4.1 degrees above
absolute zero), its resistance suddenly fell to zero.
This phenomenon was named superconductivity.
Other metals, such as lead at 7.2 K, also become
superconductors.
When charge flows in a superconductor it can
continue in that superconductor without the need
for any potential difference and without dissipating
any energy. This means that large currents can occur
without the unwanted heating effect that would occur
in a normal metallic or semiconducting conductor. Figure 11.1 The Japanese JR-Maglev train, capable of speeds

Thermistors  
Thermistors are components that are designed to have  
a resistance which changes rapidly with temperature.  
Thermistors (‘thermal resistors’) are made from metal  
oxides such as those of manganese and nickel. There are  
two distinct types of thermistor:  
■■ Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors – 159  
the resistance of this type of thermistor decreases with  
increasing temperature. Those commonly used for physics  
teaching may have a resistance of many thousands of ohms

You should become familiar with the properties of NTC  
thermistors.

resistance of this type of thermistor rises abruptly at a  
definite temperature, usually around 100–150 °C.

The semiconductor diode is another example of a non-ohmic

Chapter 11: Resistance and resistivity  
Understanding the origin of resistance  
To understand a little more about the origins of resistance,  
it is helpful to look at how the resistance of a pure metal  
wire changes as its temperature is increased. This is shown  
in the graph of Figure 11.9. You will see that the resistance  
of the pure metal increases linearly as the temperature  
increases from 0 °C to 100 °C. Compare this with the graph  
of Figure 11.10 for an NTC thermistor; the thermistor’s

LEDs have traditionally been used as indicator lamps  
to show when an appliance is switched on. Newer versions,  
some of which produce white light, are replacing filament  
lamps, for example in traffic lights and torches (flashlights)  
– see Figure 11.8. Although they are more expensive to  
manufacture, they are more energy-efficient and hence  
cheaper to run, so that the overall cost is less.  
The threshold voltage at which an LED starts to  
conduct and emit light is higher than 0.6 V and depends  
on the colour of light it emits, but may be taken to be  
about 2 V.

Chapter 13: Waves  
Vibrations making waves  
The wind blowing across the surface of the sea  
produces waves. The surface of the water starts to  
move up and down, and these vibrations spread  
outwards – big waves may travel thousands of  
kilometres across the ocean before they break on a  
beach (Figure 13.1).  
Figure 13.1 This photograph shows a wave breaking on the  
shore and dissipating the energy it has drawn from the wind  
in its journey across the ocean. The two scientists are ‘storm  
chasers’ who are recording the waves produced by a hurricane  
in the Gulf of Mexico.  
Describing waves  
When you pluck the string of a guitar, it vibrates. The  
vibrations create a wave in the air which we call sound. In  
179  
fact, all vibrations produce waves of one type or another  
(Figure 13.2). Waves that move through a material (or a  
vacuum) are called progressive waves. A progressive wave  
transfers energy from one position to another.  
At the seaside, a wave is what we see on the surface of  
the sea. The water moves around and a wave travels across  
the surface. In physics, we extend the idea of a wave to  
describe many other phenomena, including light, sound,  
etc. We do this by imagining an idealised wave, as shown  
in Figure 13.3 – you will never see such a perfect wave on  
the sea!

Figure 13.3 or a similar graph of displacement against  
time illustrates the following important definitions about  
waves and wave motion:  
1 Determine the wavelength and amplitude of each  
■■ The distance of a point on the wave from its undisturbed of the two waves shown in Figure 13.5.  
position or equilibrium position is called the displacement x.  
■■ The maximum displacement of any point on the wave  
from its undisturbed position is called the amplitude A.  
The amplitude of a wave on the sea is measured in units  
of distance, e.g. metres. The greater the amplitude of the  
wave, the louder the sound or the rougher the sea!  
■■ The distance from any point on a wave to the next exactly  
similar point (e.g. crest to crest) is called the wavelength λ  
(the Greek letter lambda). The wavelength of a wave on the  
sea is measured in units of distance, e.g. metres.  
■■ The time taken for one complete oscillation of a point in a  
wave is called the period T. It is the time taken for a point to  
move from one particular position and return to that same  
position, moving in the same direction. It is measured in  
units of time, e.g. seconds..  
■■ The number of oscillations per unit time of a point in a  
wave is called its frequency f. For sound waves, the higher  
the frequency of a musical note, the higher is its pitch.  
Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz = one  
oscillation per second (1 kHz = 103 Hz and 1 MHz = 106 Hz).  
The frequency f of a wave is the reciprocal of the period T:  
180 1  
f =  
### T

Waves are called mechanical waves if they need a  
substance (medium) through which to travel. Sound is one  
example of such a wave. Other cases are waves on strings,  
seismic waves and water waves (Figure 13.4).  
Some properties of typical waves are given on page 183  
in Table 13.1.

creates a vibration, which in turn gives rise to waves on the

Figure 13.5 Two waves – for Question 1.  
BOX 13.1: Measuring frequency  
You can measure the frequency of sound waves  
using a cathode-ray oscilloscope (c.r.o.). Figure 13.6  
shows how.  
A microphone is connected to the input of the  
c.r.o. Sound waves are captured by the microphone  
and converted into a varying voltage which has the  
same frequency as the sound waves. This voltage is  
displayed on the c.r.o. screen.  
It is best to think of a c.r.o. as a voltmeter which  
is capable of displaying a rapidly varying voltage. To  
do this, its spot moves across the screen at a steady  
speed, set by the time-base control. At the same  
time, the spot moves up and down according to the  
voltage of the input.  
Hence the display on the screen is a graph of the  
varying voltage, with time on the (horizontal) x-axis.  
If we know the horizontal scale, we can determine  
the period and hence the frequency of the sound  
wave. Worked example 1 shows how to do this. (In  
Chapter 15 we will look at one method of measuring  
the wavelength of sound waves.)

Push the end of the spring back and forth; the segments  
of the spring become compressed and then stretched out,  
along the length of the spring. Wave pulses run along the  
spring. These are longitudinal waves.  
Waggle the end of the slinky spring from side to side.  
The segments of the spring move from side to side as the  
wave travels along the spring. These are transverse waves.  
So the distinction between longitudinal and transverse  
waves is as follows:  
■■ In longitudinal waves, the particles of the medium vibrate  
parallel to the direction of the wave velocity.  
■■ In transverse waves, the particles of the medium vibrate at  
right angles to the direction of the wave velocity.

The approximate value for the speed of light in a vacuum

Light waves show the Doppler effect in the same way  
that sound waves do. So, for example, if an astronomer  
looks at the light from a distant star which is receding  
from Earth at speed v, its wavelength will be increased

Chapter 14: Superposition of waves  
Combining waves  
Light travels as waves and can produce beautiful,  
natural effects such as the iridescent colours of a  
butterfly’s wing (Figure 14.1). However, these colours  
do not come from pigments in the wing. Instead, they  
arise when light waves, scattered from different points  
on the wing, meet in your eye and combine to produce  
the colours that we see.  
Figure 14.1 The iridescent colours on a butterfly’s wing  
demonstrate the beauty of nature. In this chapter we will  
study the effect known as interference, which leads to the  
production of these glorious colours.

At position B, both waves have positive displacement. The

At position C, the displacement of one wave is positive  
while the other is negative. The resultant displacement  
lies between the two displacements. In fact, the resultant  
displacement is the algebraic sum of the displacements of  
waves A and B; that is, their sum, taking account of their  
signs (positive or negative).  
We can work our way along the distance axis in  
this way, calculating the resultant of the two waves by  
algebraically adding them up at intervals. Notice that, for  
these two waves, the resultant wave is a rather complex  
wave with dips and bumps along its length.  
The idea that we can find the resultant of two  
waves which meet at a point simply by adding up the  
displacements at each point is called the principle of  
superposition of waves. This principle can be applied to  
more than two waves and also to all types of waves. A  
statement of the principle of superposition is shown below:  
When two or more waves meet at a point, the resultant  
displacement is the algebraic sum of the displacements  
of the individual waves.

those shown in Figure 14.4. (These are easier to  
work with than sinusoidal waves.) One should  
have wavelength 8 cm and amplitude 2 cm; the  
other wavelength 16 cm and amplitude 3 cm.  
Use the principle of superposition of waves to  
determine the resultant displacement at suitable  
points along the waves, and draw the complete  
resultant wave.

Diffraction of waves  
You should be aware that all waves (such as sound and light)  
can be reflected and refracted. Another wave phenomenon  
that applies to all waves is that they can be diffracted.  
Diffraction is the spreading of a wave as it passes through a  
gap or around an edge. It is easy to observe and investigate  
diffraction effects using water waves, as shown in Box 14.1.  
Diffraction of sound and light  
Diffraction effects are greatest when waves pass through a  
gap with a width roughly equal to their wavelength. This  
is useful in explaining why we can observe diffraction  
readily for some waves, but not for others. For example,  
sound waves in the audible range have wavelengths from a  
few millimetres to a few metres. Thus we might expect to  
observe diffraction effects for sound in our environment.  
Sounds, for example, diffract as they pass through  
doorways. The width of a doorway is comparable to the  
wavelength of a sound and so a noise in one room spreads  
out into the next room.  
Visible light has much shorter wavelengths (about  
5 × 10−7 m). It is not diffracted noticeably by doorways  
because the width of the gap is a million times larger  
than the wavelength of light. However, we can observe  
### QUESTION

diffraction of light by passing it through a very narrow  
slit or a small hole. When laser light is directed onto a  
slit whose width is comparable to the wavelength of the  
incident light, it spreads out into the space beyond to form  
a smear on the screen (Figure 14.5). An adjustable slit  
allows you to see the effect of gradually narrowing the gap.  
You can see the effects of diffraction for yourself by  
making a narrow slit with your two thumbs and looking  
through the slit at a distant light source (Figure 14.8). By  
gently pressing your thumbs together to narrow the gap  
between them, you can see the effect of narrowing the slit.

BOX 14.1: Observing diff raction in a ripple tank  
A ripple tank can be used to show diff raction. Plane they arrive at the gap, however, they pass through and  
waves are generated using a vibrating bar, and move spread out into the space beyond. It is this spreading  
towards a gap in a barrier (Figure 14.6). Where the out of waves as they travel through a gap (or past the  
ripples strike the barrier, they are reflected back. Where edge of a barrier) that is called diff raction.  
The extent to which ripples are diff racted depends  
on the width of the gap. This is illustrated in Figure 14.6.  
The lines in this diagram show the wavefronts. It is as  
if we are looking down on the ripples from above, and  
drawing lines to represent the tops of the ripples at  
some instant in time. The separation between adjacent  
wavefronts is equal to the wavelength λ of the ripples.  
When the waves encounter a gap in a barrier, the  
amount of diff raction depends on the width of the gap.  
There is hardly any noticeable diff raction when the gap  
is very much larger than the wavelength. As the gap  
becomes narrower, the diff raction eff ect becomes more  
pronounced. It is greatest when the width of the gap is

Figure 14.7 The extent to which ripples spread out depends on the relationship between their wavelength and  
the width of the gap. In a, the width of the gap is very much greater than the wavelength and there is hardly any  
noticeable diff raction. In b, the width of the gap is greater than the wavelength and there is limited diff raction.  
In c, the gap width is approximately equal to the wavelength and the diff raction eff ect is greatest.

through a narrow slit. What happens when you make the slit  
narrower? What happens to the amount of diff raction when  
you put diff erent coloured filters in front of the lamp? What  
does this tell you about the wavelengths of the diff erent  
colours?

Interference in a ripple tank  
The two dippers in the ripple tank (Figure 14.12) a  
should be positioned so that they are just touching  
the surface of the water. When the bar vibrates, each  
dipper acts as a source of circular ripples spreading  
outwards. Where these sets of ripples overlap, we  
observe an interference pattern. Another way to  
observe interference in a ripple tank is to use plane  
waves passing through two gaps in a barrier. The  
water waves are diffracted at the two gaps and then b  
interfere beyond the gaps. Figure 14.13 shows the  
interference pattern produced by two vibrating  
sources in a ripple tank. 197

198 (Figure 14.16). The slits are two clear lines on a black  
slide, separated by a fraction of a millimetre. Where  
the light falls on the screen, a series of equally

At point A in Figure 14.15, the waves from the red

The path difference between the two sets of waves is  
1 wavelength. A path difference of 1 wavelength is  
equivalent to a phase difference of zero. This means that  
they are in phase, so they interfere constructively.  
Now think about destructive interference. At  
point B, the waves from the red source have travelled  
3 wavelengths; the waves from the yellow source have  
travelled 2.5 wavelengths. The path difference between the Figure 14.16 Light beams from the two slits interfere

We usually need specially arranged conditions to

about the demonstration with two loudspeakers. If they

different frequencies, the sound waves might start off in

The Young double-slit  
experiment  
Now we will take a close look at a famous experiment  
which Thomas Young performed in 1801. He used this  
experiment to show the wave nature of light. A beam  
of light is shone on a pair of parallel slits placed at right  
angles to the beam. Light diffracts and spreads outwards  
from each slit into the space beyond; the light from the two  
slits overlaps on a screen. An interference pattern of light  
and dark bands called ‘fringes’ is formed on the screen.  
Explaining the experiment  
In order to observe interference, we need two sets of waves.  
The sources of the waves must be coherent – the phase  
difference between the waves emitted at the sources must  
remain constant. This also means that the waves must have  
the same wavelength. Today, this is readily achieved by  
passing a single beam of laser light through the two slits.  
A laser produces intense coherent light. As the light passes  
through the slits, it is diffracted so that it spreads out into the  
space beyond (Figure 14.20). Now we have two overlapping

By connecting the two loudspeakers to the same signal

generator, we can be sure that the sound waves that they interference.  
produce are constantly in phase with one another. We  
say that they act as two coherent sources of sound waves  
(coherent means sticking together). Coherent sources emit  
waves that have a constant phase difference. Note that  
the two waves can only have a constant phase difference if  
their frequency is the same and remains constant.  
Now think about the laser experiment. Could we have  
used two lasers producing exactly the same frequency and  
hence wavelength of light? Figure 14.19a represents the  
light from a laser. We can think of it as being made up of  
many separate bursts of light. We cannot guarantee that  
these bursts from two lasers will always be in phase with  
one another.  
This problem is overcome by using a single laser  
and dividing its light using the two slits (Figure 14.19b).  
The slits act as two coherent sources of light. They are  
constantly in phase with one another (or there is a  
constant phase difference between them).  
If they were not coherent sources, the interference  
pattern would be constantly changing, far too fast for our  
eyes to detect. We would simply see a uniform band of  
light, without any definite bright and dark regions. From  
this you should be able to see that, in order to observe  
interference, we need two coherent sources of waves.

Nodes and antinodes  
What you have observed is a stationary wave on the long  
spring. There are points along the spring that remain  
(almost) motionless while points on either side are  
oscillating with the greatest amplitude. The points that  
do not move are called the nodes and the points where  
the spring oscillates with maximum amplitude are called  
the antinodes. At the same time, it is clear that the wave  
profile is not travelling along the length of the spring.  
Hence we call it a stationary wave or a standing wave.  
We normally represent a stationary wave by drawing  
the shape of the spring in its two extreme positions  
(Figure 15.4). The spring appears as a series of loops,  
separated by nodes. In this diagram, point A is moving  
downwards. At the same time, point B in the next loop  
is moving upwards. The phase difference between points  
A and B is 180°. Hence the sections of spring in adjacent  
loops are always moving in antiphase; they are half a cycle  
out of phase with one another.

Microwaves  
Start by directing the microwave transmitter at a metal 4  
plate, which reflects the microwaves back towards the  
source (Figure 15.8). Move the probe receiver around  
in the space between the transmitter and the reflector  
and you will observe positions of high and low intensity.  
This is because a stationary wave is set up between the  
transmitter and the sheet; the positions of high and low  
intensity are the antinodes and nodes respectively.

If the probe is moved along the direct line from  
the transmitter to the plate, the wavelength of the  
microwaves can be determined from the distance  
between the nodes. Knowing that microwaves travel

of a phenomenon called resonance. The experiment  
reflecting  
sheet described here is known as the resonance tube.  
For resonance to occur, the length of the air column  
must be just right. The air at the bottom of the tube is  
probe unable to vibrate, so this point must be a node. The air  
at the open end of the tube can vibrate most freely, so  
this is an antinode. Hence the length of the air column  
must be one-quarter of a wavelength (Figure 15.10a).  
(Alternatively, the length of the air column could be  
set to equal three-quarters of a wavelength – see  
microwave Figure 15.10b.)

should hear a note whose pitch depends on the length  
of the tube. Now cover the bottom of the tube with the  
palm of your hand and repeat the process. The pitch of  
the note now produced will be about an octave higher  
than the previous note, which means that the frequency  
is approximately twice the original frequency.  
It is rather surprising that a standing wave can be set  
up in an open column of air in this way. What is going  
on? Figure 15.12 compares the situation for open and  
closed tubes. An open-ended tube has two open ends,  
so there must be an antinode at each end. There is a

Radioactivity at work  
Radioactive substances have many uses, for example  
in engineering and medicine. They must be handled  
with great care to ensure that no-one becomes  
contaminated and so exposed to the radiation which  
comes from these substances (Figure 16.1). In this  
chapter we will look at the nature of radioactive  
substances and the different types of radiation they  
produce.  
Figure 16.1 A worker at a nuclear power station is checked for  
any radioactive material on his body.  
Looking inside the atom  
The idea that matter is composed of very small particles These α-particles were known to be smaller than  
called atoms was first suggested by the Greeks some 2000 atoms, and had relatively high kinetic energies. Hence  
years ago. However, it was not until the middle of the 19th they were useful in experiments designed to discover the  
century that any ideas about the inside of the atom were composition of atoms. 223  
proposed.  
It was the English scientist J.J. Thomson who suggested  
that the atom is a neutral particle made of a positive charge  
with lumps of negative charge (electrons) in it. He could  
not determine the charge and the mass of the negative  
particles separately, but it was clear that a new particle,  
probably much smaller than the hydrogen atom, had been  
discovered. Since atoms are neutral and physicists had  
discovered a negatively charged part of an atom, it meant  
that there were both positive and negative charges in an  
atom. We now call this the plum pudding model of the  
atom (positive pudding with negative plums!).  
Other experiments show that the electron has a mass  
of approximately 9.11 × 10−31 kg (m) and a charge of  
e  
−1.60 × 10−19 C (−e). Today we use the idea of the electron  
to explain all sorts of phenomena, including electrostatics,  
current electricity and electronics.  
Alpha-particle scattering and  
the nucleus  
Early in the 20th century, many physicists were  
investigating the recently discovered phenomenon of  
Figure 16.2 Ernest Rutherford (on the right) in the  
radioactivity, the process whereby unstable nuclei emit Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, England. He had a loud  
radiation. One kind of radiation they found consisted of voice that could disturb sensitive apparatus and so the  
what they called α-particles (alpha-particles). notice was a joke aimed at him.

After Rutherford had presented his findings, the nuclear

was partly because it helped chemists to explain the  
phenomenon of chemical bonding (the way in which

Any atom is electrically neutral (it has no net positive or  
negative charge), so the number of electrons surrounding  
the nucleus must equal the number of protons in the  
nucleus of the atom. If an atom gains or loses an electron,  
it is no longer electrically neutral and is called an ion.  
For an atom, the number of protons (and hence the  
number of electrons) determines the chemical properties  
of the atom. The number of protons and the number of  
neutrons determine the nuclear properties. It is important  
to realise that, since the number of protons, and therefore  
the number of electrons, in isotopes of the same element  
are identical, they will all have the same chemical  
properties but very different nuclear properties.

However, in the middle decades of the 20th century,  
physicists discovered many other particles that did not fit  
this pattern. They gave them names such as pions, kaons,  
muons, etc., using up most of the letters of the Greek  
alphabet.  
These new particles were found in two ways:  
■■ by looking at cosmic rays, which are particles that arrive at  
the Earth from outer space  
■■ by looking at the particles produced by high-energy  
collisions in particle accelerators (Figure 16.9).

Practical work in physics  
Throughout your A level physics course you will develop  
your skills in practical work, and they will be assessed at  
both AS and A level. This chapter outlines the skills you  
will develop in the first year of the course; it includes some  
activities to test your understanding as you go along.  
The sciences differ from most other subjects in that  
they involve not only theory but also practical work. The  
very essence of science is that theory can be tested by  
practical experiment. So the ability to carry out practical  
exercises in a logical and scientific manner is essential.  
Using apparatus and following  
instructions  
You need to familiarise yourself with the use of simple  
measuring instruments such as metre rules, balances,  
Calipers

Figure P1.2 Parallax error.  
Figure P1.1 When reading from a scale, make sure that you  
know what each division on the scale represents.  
If you use instruments incorrectly, you may introduce  
errors into your readings. For example, when taking a  
reading your line of sight should always be perpendicular  
to the scale that you are using. Otherwise you will  
introduce a parallax error; this is shown in Figure P1.2.  
Looking from point A the length of the rod appears to  
be 21 mm, from point C it appears to be 25 mm and from  
point B, the correct position, the length is 23 mm.  
A rule, for example a metre rule, or a ruler, for example  
an ordinary school ruler of length 30 cm, are simple  
measuring instruments with a smallest division of 1 mm.  
Other instruments have a greater precision because their  
smallest scale division is less than 1 mm. Here we will look  
at two of these. Figure P1.3 Using dial calipers.

We will first consider the precision of a measurement. uncertainty of 0.5 mm, giving a total uncertainty of 1 mm.  
The level of precision is high if you make several The uncertainty will depend not only on the precision

may still have to estimate the uncertainty in your reading  
without knowing the true value. So how is this done?  
First, it should be understood that the uncertainty  
is only an estimate of the difference between the actual  
reading and the true value. We should not feel too worried  
if the difference between a single measurement and the  
243  
true value is as much as twice the uncertainty. Because  
it is an estimate, the uncertainty is likely to be given to  
only one significant figure. For example, we write the  
uncertainty as 0.5 cm and not 0.50 cm.  
The uncertainty can be estimated in two ways.  
Using the division on the scale – Look at the smallest  
x division on the scale used for the reading. You then have to

Even using a digital meter is not without difficulties.  
For example if a digital ammeter reads 0.35 A then,  
without any more information, the uncertainty is ± 0.01 A,  
the smallest digit on the meter. But if you look at the  
handbook for the ammeter you may well find that the  
uncertainty is ± 0.02 or 0.03 A (although you cannot be  
expected to know this).

Chapter 17: Circular motion  
Moving in circles  
The racing car in Figure 17.1 shows two examples of  
circular motion. The car’s wheels spin around the  
axles, and the car follows a curved path as it speeds  
round the bend.

Describing circular motion  
Many things move in circles. Here are some examples:

■■ the Earth in its (approximately circular) orbit round the Sun θ θ = 0 259  
■■ the hands of a clock  
■■ a spinning DVD in a laptop  
■■ the drum of a washing machine.  
Sometimes, things move along a path that is part of a  
circle. For example, the car in Figure 17.1 is travelling Figure 17.2 To know how far an object has moved round the

Angles in radians Defining the radian  
An angle of one radian is defined as follows (see Figure 17.4):  
When dealing with circles and circular motion, it is more  
convenient to measure angles and angular displacements  
in units called radians rather than in degrees. If an object One radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle  
moves a distance s around a circular path of radius r by an arc of length equal to the radius of the circle.  
(Figure 17.3a), its angular displacement θ in radians is  
defined as follows:

angle (in radians) =  
radius  
r  
s r  
or θ =  
r  
1 radian  
Since both s and r are distances measured in metres,  
it follows that the angle θ is simply a ratio. It is a  
dimensionless quantity. If the object moves twice as  
far around a circle of twice the radius (Figure 17.3b), its  
angular displacement θ will be the same.

θ = = = Figure 17.4 The length of the arc is equal to the radius when

the angle is 1 radian.

An angle of 360° is equivalent to an angle of 2π radians.

or 1 radian ≈ 57.3°  
If you can remember that there are 2π rad in a full circle,

Gravitational forces and fields  
According to Newton, all masses create a  
gravitational field in the space around them. This field  
gives rise to a force on any object having mass which is  
placed in this field. The Moon orbits the Earth because  
it experiences a gravitational force due to the Earth’s

In Chapter 8 we saw how to represent an electric field

Earth’s gravitational field by drawing field lines, as shown  
in Figure 18.3. The field lines show two things:  
■■ The arrows on the field lines show us the direction of the  
gravitational force on a mass placed in the field.  
■■ The spacing of the field lines indicates the strength of the

Oscillations in an engine  
Figure 19.1 shows a cut-away view of a modern car  
engine; there are four pistons which oscillate up to  
5000 times per minute when the engine is operating at  
full power. Engineers need to understand the physics  
of oscillations to be able to calculate the stresses  
produced on the pistons when the engine is operating.  
Figure 19.1 The pistons inside this car engine oscillate up and

These examples of oscillations and vibrations may seem  
very different from one another. In this chapter, we will  
look at the characteristics that are shared by all oscillations.  
Free or forced?  
The easiest oscillations to understand are free oscillations.  
If you pluck a guitar string, it continues to vibrate for some  
time after you have released it. It vibrates at a particular  
frequency (the number of vibrations per unit time). This is  
called its natural frequency of vibration, and it gives rise  
to the particular note that you hear. Change the length  
of the string, and you change the natural frequency. In  
a similar way, the prongs of a tuning fork have a natural  
frequency of vibration, which you can observe when you Figure 19.2 A ruler vibrating freely at its natural frequency.

BOX 19.1: Observing slow oscillations  
A mass–spring system  
A trolley, loaded with extra masses, is tethered by  
identical springs in between two clamps (Figure 19.3).  
Displace the trolley to one side and it will oscillate  
back and forth along the bench. Listen to the sound  
of the trolley moving. Where is it moving fastest?  
What happens to its speed as it reaches the ends of its  
oscillation? What is happening to the springs as the  
trolley oscillates?

How does this motion compare with that of the  
pendulum and the mass–spring system? Try using  
a higher frequency (say, 100 Hz). Use an electronic

Describing oscillations  
All of these examples show the same pattern of movement.  
The trolley accelerates as it moves towards the centre  
of the oscillation. It is moving fastest at the centre. It  
decelerates as it moves towards the end of the oscillation.  
At the extreme position, it stops momentarily, reverses its  
direction and accelerates back towards the centre again.  
Amplitude, period and frequency

difference between two oscillations. The graph of Figure  
19.9a shows two oscillations which are identical except  
for their phase difference. They are out of step with one  
another. In this example, they have a phase difference  
of one-quarter of an oscillation. Phase difference can be  
measured as a fraction of an oscillation, in degrees or in  
radians (see Worked example 1).

Simple harmonic motion  
### QUESTION

There are many situations where we can observe the  
special kind of oscillations called simple harmonic motion  
(s.h.m.). Some are more obvious than others. For example,  
the vibrating strings of a musical instrument show s.h.m.  
When plucked or bowed, the strings move back and forth  
about the equilibrium position of their oscillation. The  
motion of the tethered trolley in Figure 19.3 and that  
of the pendulum in Figure 19.4 are also s.h.m. (Simple  
a  
harmonic motion is defined in terms of the acceleration  
0 and displacement of an oscillator – see pages 294–5.)  
Time Here are some other, less obvious, situations where  
simple harmonic motion can be found:  
■■ When a pure (single tone) sound wave travels through air,  
b  
the molecules of the air vibrate with s.h.m.  
0 ■■ When an alternating current flows in a wire, the electrons in  
Time the wire vibrate with s.h.m.  
■■ There is a small alternating electric current in a radio or  
television aerial when it is tuned to a signal, in the form of  
c electrons moving with s.h.m.  
■■ The atoms that make up a molecule vibrate with s.h.m. (see,  
0  
for example, the hydrogen molecule in Figure 19.11a).

Oscillations can be very complex, with many different  
frequencies of oscillation occurring at the same time.  
Examples include the vibrations of machinery, the motion  
of waves on the sea and the vibration of a solid crystal  
formed when atoms, ions or molecules bond together  
(Figure 19.11b). It is possible to break down a complex  
oscillation into a sum of simple oscillations, and so we

The changes of velocity in s.h.m.  
As the pendulum swings back and forth, its velocity is  
b constantly changing. As it swings from right to left (as  
shown in Figure 19.12) its velocity is negative. It accelerates  
towards the equilibrium position and then decelerates as it  
approaches the other end of the oscillation. It has positive  
velocity as it swings back from left to right. Again, it has  
maximum speed as it travels through the equilibrium  
position and decelerates as it swings up to its starting

position.

In the next section we will see how we can observe these  
changes and how we can represent them graphically.

The three requirements for s.h.m. of a mechanical  
system are:  
■■ a mass that oscillates  
■■ a position where the mass is in equilibrium (conventionally,  
displacement x to the right of this position is taken as  
positive; to the left it is negative)  
■■ a restoring force that acts to return the mass to its  
equilibrium position; the restoring force F is directly  
proportional to the displacement x of the mass from its  
equilibrium position and is directed towards that point.

Damped oscillations  
In principle, oscillations can go on for ever. In practice,  
however, the oscillations we observe around us do not.  
They die out, either rapidly or gradually. A child on a swing  
knows that the amplitude of her swinging will decline until  
eventually she will come to rest, unless she can put some  
more energy into the swinging to keep it going.  
This happens because of friction. On a swing, there  
is friction where the swing is attached to the frame and  
there is friction with the air. The amplitude of the child’s  
oscillations decreases as the friction transfers energy away  
from her to the surroundings.  
We describe these oscillations as damped. Their  
amplitude decreases according to a particular pattern. This  
is shown in Figure 19.25.

The amplitude of damped oscillations does not  
decrease linearly. It decays exponentially with time. An  
exponential decay is a particular mathematical pattern  
that arises as follows. At first, the swing moves rapidly.  
There is a lot of air resistance to overcome, so the swing  
loses energy quickly and its amplitude decreases at a  
high rate. Later, it is moving more slowly. There is less  
air resistance and so energy is lost more slowly – the

amplitude of the oscillations decreases and can be  
measured every five oscillations by judging the position  
of the blade against a ruler fixed alongside.  
Energy and damping  
Damping can be very useful if we want to get rid of  
vibrations. For example, a car has springs (Figure 19.28)  
which make the ride much more comfortable for us when  
the car goes over a bump. However, we wouldn’t want  
to spend every car journey vibrating up and down as a  
reminder of the last bump we went over. So the springs are  
damped by the shock absorbers, and we return rapidly to a  
smooth ride after every bump.

amplitude decreases at a lower rate. Hence we get the  
characteristic curved shape, which is the ‘envelope’ of the  
graph in Figure 19.25.  
Notice that the frequency of the oscillations does not  
change as the amplitude decreases. This is a characteristic  
of simple harmonic motion. The child may, for example,  
swing back and forth once every two seconds, and this  
stays the same whether the amplitude is large or small.

Resonance  
Resonance is an important physical phenomenon that can  
appear in a great many different situations. A dramatic  
example is the Millennium Footbridge in London, opened  
299  
in June 2000 (Figure 19.29). With up to 2000 pedestrians  
Figure 19.29 The ‘wobbly’ Millennium Footbridge in London

The people also swayed in time with the bridge, and resonance.  
BOX 19.3: Observing resonance  
Resonance can be observed with almost any oscillating  
system. The system is forced to oscillate at a particular  
frequency. If the forcing frequency happens to match  
the natural frequency of oscillation of the system, the  
amplitude of the resulting oscillations can build up to  
become very large.  
Barton’s pendulums  
Barton’s pendulums is a demonstration of this (Figure  
19.30). Several pendulums of different lengths hang  
from a horizontal string. Each has its own natural  
frequency of oscillation. The ‘driver’ pendulum at the  
end is different; it has a large mass at the end, and  
its length is equal to that of one of the others. When  
the driver is set swinging, the others gradually start  
to move. However, only the pendulum whose length

matches that of the driver pendulum builds up a large  
amplitude so that it is resonating.

pendulum is the same as that of the driver, and so it  
gains energy and its amplitude gradually builds up. The  
other pendulums have different natural frequencies, so  
the driver has little effect.  
In a similar way, if you were to push the child on the  
swing once every three-quarters of an oscillation, you  
would soon find that the swing was moving backwards  
as you tried to push it forwards, so that your push  
would slow it down.  
A mass–spring system  
You can observe resonance for yourself with a simple  
mass–spring system. You need a mass on the end of a  
spring (Figure 19.31), chosen so that the mass oscillates  
up and down with a natural frequency of about 1 Hz.  
Now hold the top end of the spring and move your hand  
up and down rapidly, with an amplitude of a centimetre  
or two. Very little happens. Now move your hand up and  
300  
down more slowly, close to 1 Hz. Figure 19.31 Resonance with a mass on a spring.  
Defining resonance  
For resonance to occur, we must have a system that is  
capable of oscillating freely. We must also have some way  
in which the system is forced to oscillate. When the forcing  
frequency matches the natural frequency of the system, the  
amplitude of the oscillations grows dramatically.  
If the driving frequency does not quite match the  
natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations will  
increase, but not to the same extent as when resonance  
is achieved. Figure 19.32 shows how the amplitude of  
oscillations depends on the driving frequency in the  
region close to resonance.  
In resonance, energy is transferred from the driver  
to the resonating system more efficiently than when  
resonance does not occur. For example, in the case of the natural Driving frequency  
frequency  
Millennium Footbridge, energy was transferred from  
the pedestrians to the bridge, causing large-amplitude  
oscillations.

The following statements apply to any system in  
resonance:  
■■ Its natural frequency is equal to the frequency of the driver.  
■■ Its amplitude is maximum.  
■■ It absorbs the greatest possible energy from the driver.

Resonance and damping An everyday example of damping can be seen on  
some doors. For example, a restaurant may have a door  
During earthquakes, buildings are forced to oscillate by  
leading to the kitchen; this door can swing open in either

in serious damage (Figure 19.33). In regions of the world

position. To achieve this, the door hinges (or the closing  
waves. In this way, the vibrations are ‘damped’ so that  
mechanism) must be correctly damped. If the hinges are  
the amplitude of the oscillations cannot reach dangerous  
damped too lightly, the door will swing back and forth  
levels. This is an expensive business, and so far is restricted  
several times as it closes. If the damping is too heavy, it  
to the wealthier parts of the world.  
will take too long to close. With critical damping, the  
door will swing closed quickly without oscillating.  
Critical damping is thus the minimum amount of  
damping required to return an oscillator to its equilibrium  
position without oscillating. Under-damping results in  
unwanted oscillations; over-damping results in a slower  
return to equilibrium (see Figure 19.35). A car’s suspension  
system uses springs to smooth out bumps in the road.  
It is usually critically damped so that passengers do not  
experience nasty vibrations every time the car goes over  
a bump.

Damping is thus useful if we want to reduce the

damping alters the resonance response curve of Figure

damped system returns to equilibrium without oscillating.  
the amplitude of the resonant vibrations decreases. The  
resonance peak becomes broader. There is also an effect on  
the frequency at which resonance occurs, which becomes Using resonance  
lower as the damping increases.  
As we have seen, resonance can be a problem in  
mechanical systems. However, it can also be useful. For  
example, many musical instruments rely on resonance.  
Resonance is not confined to mechanical systems. It  
is made use of in, for example, microwave cooking. The  
microwaves used have a frequency that matches a natural  
frequency of vibration of water molecules (the microwave  
is the ‘driver’ and the molecule is the ‘resonating system’).  
The water molecules in the food are forced to vibrate and  
they absorb the energy of the microwave radiation. The  
water gets hotter and the absorbed energy spreads through  
the food and cooks or heats it.

vibrations.

Communications today  
The ability to communicate is an important feature  
of modern life. We can now speak directly to others  
right around the world and generate vast amounts of  
information every day. The invention of the mobile  
phone has increased our ability to talk to one another  
and to find out what is happening around us. This  
chapter looks briefly at how some communications  
systems work. Communications engineers have  
applied the principles of physics to change the present  
and shape the future.

Radio waves  
The person listening to the radio in Figure 20.2 is at the Sound waves and radio waves are completely different

sound or music passing into a microphone. The sound

again into a sound signal. ■■ Radio waves are electromagnetic waves which travel at the  
speed of light (3.0 × 106 m s−1 in a vacuum). Their frequencies  
are much higher than those of sound waves.  
(You should recall from Chapter 13 that wave speed v,  
frequency f and wavelength λ are related by v = f λ.)  
To allow several radio stations to broadcast, each signal  
has a different carrier wave frequency. To hear just one  
station at a time, you tune the radio receiver so that it  
separates out radio waves of a single frequency.  
The information, for example a sound signal, is carried  
by modulating or altering the carrier wave. Modulation is  
the variation of either the amplitude or the frequency of  
the carrier wave. The modulated wave is the actual wave  
transmitted. The signal is present in either the changing  
amplitude or the changing frequency of the modulated wave.

In frequency modulation (FM), the modulated wave the carrier wave

### WORKED EXAMPLE

3 Radio stations, which broadcast in the long-wave  
(LW) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, use  
carrier frequencies between 140 kHz and 280 kHz.  
The sidebands are within 4.5 kHz on either side of  
the carrier frequency. State the bandwidth of each  
radio station in the LW region of the spectrum and  
calculate the maximum number of radio stations  
which can transmit in the LW region.  
Step 1 The bandwidth of an individual station is  
twice the width of an individual sideband:  
bandwidth = 2 × 4.5 = 9.0 kHz  
Step 2 The LW region is divided into regions of width  
9.0 kHz. Hence:  
allowed frequency range  
number of stations =  
bandwidth  
(280 − 140)

= 15.5 = 15 stations  
Suppose a country decides to increase the quality  
of music transmitted by each radio station. What  
happens to the bandwidth and the maximum  
number of stations in the LW region? Better sound  
quality requires an increase in the maximum  
frequency of the signal that modulates the carrier  
wave, and so the bandwidth needed increases. This  
decreases the number of available stations in the  
LW region of the spectrum.

Figure 20.9 Weakened and noisy signals.  
Figure 20.9 shows the signals from Figure 20.8 after  
they have travelled a long distance. You will see that they  
are lower in amplitude and have unwanted variations, or  
noise.  
There is little improvement possible for an analogue  
signal; amplification will not remove the noise. However,  
regeneration will remove the noise from a digital signal.  
The signal is ‘cleaned’ of the noise and returned to its  
initial shape.  
At the end of a long-distance transmission, an  
electronic circuit, the regeneration amplifier, receives the  
digital signal. This electronic circuit expects to receive a  
pulse of a few volts or no pulse at all; any small variations  
added to the pulse or the 0 V make no difference. The  
regeneration amplifier can only give a 0 or a 1 as an  
output. As long as the noise does not completely change  
the shape of the signal, then the regeneration amplifier  
returns the digital signal shown in Figure 20.9 to the  
perfect pulses shown in Figure 20.8.

The value of the sampled signal is used to produce a  
binary number. Each time that the signal is sampled the  
ADC produces a binary number of a certain number of  
bits. Since the sample is taken many times per second,  
many binary numbers are created, one after the other, and  
this series of 0s and 1s becomes the digital signal that is  
transmitted.

Firstly, the sampled signal is not always a whole  
number. For example, in Figure 20.10 when t = 300 µs the  
actual voltage is 8.3 V but only the number 8 can be sent,  
not 8.3.  
To improve the sampling, the voltage that corresponds  
to the difference between 0 and 1 must be decreased. In  
the above example, the difference between 0 and 1 in  
binary is 1 V and so the signal is ‘accurate’ to only 1 V. If

When the time t = 0, the numerical value of the voltage

signal is 9 as a decimal number. When converted into

binary, this number is 1001. When t = 100 µs, the voltage is

The kinetic model of matter can be used to describe the  
structure of solids, liquids and gases. You should recall  
that the kinetic model describes the behaviour of matter  
in terms of moving particles (atoms, molecules, etc.).  
Figure 21.2 should remind you of how we picture the three  
states of matter at the atomic scale:

their neighbours, and vibrating about fixed positions.

When water boils, it changes state – it turns to steam.
A liquid has become a gas. This is a familiar process,
but Figure 21.1 shows a dramatic example of such
a change of state. This is a geyser in New Zealand,
formed when water is trapped underground where
it is in contact with hot rocks. The temperature and
pressure of the water build up until it suddenly erupts
above the surface to form a tall plume of scalding

Energy changes  
Energy must be supplied to raise the temperature of a  
solid, to melt it, to heat the liquid and to boil it. Where  
does this energy go? It is worth taking a close look at  
a single change of state and thinking about what is  
happening on the atomic scale. Figure 21.3a shows a  
suitable arrangement. A test tube containing octadecanoic  
acid (a white, waxy substance at room temperature) is  
warmed in a water bath. At 80 °C, the substance is a clear  
liquid. The tube is then placed in a rack and allowed  
to cool. Its temperature is monitored, either with a different sections of this graph in some detail, in order to  
thermometer or with a temperature probe and datalogger. describe where the energy is going at each stage.  
Figure 21.3b shows typical results. We need to think about the kinetic and potential  
energies of the molecules. If they move around more freely  
and faster, their kinetic energy has increased. If they break  
free of their neighbours and become more disordered,  
their electrical potential energy has increased.  
329  
The temperature drops rapidly at first, then more  
slowly as it approaches room temperature. The important  
section of the graph is the region BC. The temperature  
remains steady for some time. The clear liquid is gradually  
returning to its white, waxy solid state. It is essential  
to note that energy is still being lost even though the  
temperature is not decreasing. When no liquid remains,  
the temperature starts to drop again.  
From the graph, we can deduce the melting point of  
octadecanoic acid. This is a technique used to help identify  
substances by finding their melting points.  
Heating ice  
In some ways, it is easier to think of the experiment above  
in reverse. What happens when we heat a substance?  
Imagine taking some ice from the deep freeze. Put the  
ice in a well-insulated container and heat it at a steady  
rate. Its temperature will rise; eventually we will have a  
container of water vapour. (Note that water vapour is an  
invisible gas; the ‘steam’ that you see when a kettle boils is  
not a gas but a cloud of tiny droplets of liquid water.)  
Figure 21.4 shows the results we might expect if we  
could carry out this idealised experiment. Energy is  
supplied to the ice at a constant rate. We will consider the

Figure 21.5 The electrical potential energy of atoms is  
negative and increases as they get further apart.  
You know that the kinetic energy of a particle is the  
energy it has due to its motion. Figure 21.5 shows how the  
electrical potential energy of two isolated atoms depends  
on their separation. Work must be done (energy must be  
put in) to separate neighbouring atoms – think about the  
work you must do to snap a piece of plastic or to tear a  
sheet of paper. The graph shows that:  
■■ the electrical potential energy of two atoms very close  
together is large and negative  
■■ as the separation of the atoms increases, their potential  
energy also increases  
■■ when the atoms are completely separated, their potential  
energy is maximum and has a value of zero.  
Now look at the graph shown in Figure 21.4.

very important aspect of evaporation.  
When a liquid evaporates, it is the most energetic  
molecules that are most likely to escape. This leaves  
molecules with a below-average kinetic energy. Since  
temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy  
of the molecules, it follows that the temperature of the  
evaporating liquid must fall.

Of course, you already know the answer to this. The stone

up the stone have more energy, both kinetic and electrical  
potential. They vibrate more and faster, and they move a little  
further apart. This energy of the molecules is known as the  
internal energy of the stone. The internal energy of a system  
(e.g. the heated stone) is defined as follows:  
The internal energy of a system is the sum of the random  
distribution of kinetic and potential energies of its atoms  
or molecules. Figure 21.8 The molecules of a gas have both kinetic and  
potential energy.

Some materials are easier to heat than others. It takes  
more energy to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water  
1 When 26 400 J of energy is supplied to a 2.0 kg block  
by 1 °C than to raise the temperature of 1 kg of alcohol  
of aluminium, its temperature rises from 20 °C to  
by the same amount. 35 °C. The block is well insulated so that there is  
We can represent this in an equation. The amount of no energy loss to the surroundings. Determine the  
energy E that must be supplied is given by: specific heat capacity of aluminium.  
E = mcΔθ Step 1 We are going to use the equation:  
where c is the specific heat capacity of the material. E  
c =  
Rearranging this equation gives: mΔθ  
336  
E We need to write down the quantities that we know:  
c =  
mΔθ  
E = 26 400 J m = 2.0 kg  
The specific heat capacity of a material can be defined as a  
Δθ = (35 − 20) °C = 15 °C (or 15 K)  
word equation as follows:  
Step 2 Now substitute these values and solve the  
energy supplied

The balloon is filled with helium so that its overall

result is an upthrust on the balloon, greater than its

the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere decreases  
so that the balloon expands. The temperature drops,  
which tends to make the gas in the balloon shrink. In  
this chapter we will look at the behaviour of gases as

### QUESTIONS

1 Consider a smoke particle of mass M and speed V.  
It is constantly buffeted by air molecules. The mass  
of a single air molecule is m and it has speed v. It is  
reasonable to assume that, on average, the smoke  
particle will have kinetic energy approximately  
equal to the kinetic energy of a single air molecule.  
Show that, since M >> m (M is much greater  
than m), it follows that the air molecules must be  
moving much faster than the smoke grain (v >> V ).  
2 If equal numbers of air molecules hit a smoke  
particle from all directions, the smoke particle  
does not move. State three ways in which the  
random movement of molecules of air cause the  
smoke particles to move.

see through a microscope observing Brownian

Chapter 23: Coulomb’s law  
Electric potential 0 V  
When we discussed gravitational potential (page 276), we  
started from the idea of potential energy. The potential  
at a point is then the potential energy of unit mass at the  
point. We will approach the idea of electrical potential in  
the same way. However, you may be relieved to find that  
you already know something about the idea of electrical  
potential, because you know about voltage and potential  
difference. This section shows how we formalise the  
idea of voltage, and why we use the expression ‘potential  
difference’ for some kinds of voltage.  
Electric potential energy  
When an electric charge moves through an electric field,  
its potential energy changes. Think about this concrete  
example: if you want to move one positive charge closer to  
another positive charge, you have to push it (Figure 23.6).  
This is simply because there is a force of repulsion between increases steadily as we push it from the negative plate to  
the charges. You have to do work in order to move one the positive plate. The graph of potential energy against  
charge closer to the other. distance is a straight line, as shown in Figure 23.7b.  
We can calculate the change in potential energy of  
a charge Q as it is moved from the negative plate to the  
positive plate very simply. Potential difference is defined as  
363  
the energy change per coulomb between two points (recall  
from Chapter 9 that one volt is one joule per coulomb).  
Hence, for charge Q, the work done in moving it from the  
negative plate to the positive plate is:  
### W = QV

We can rearrange this equation as:  
### W

### V =

### Q

This is really how voltage V is defined. It is the energy  
per unit positive charge at a point in an electric field.  
By analogy with gravitational potential, we call this the  
electric potential at a point. Now you should be able to see  
that what we regard as the familiar idea of voltage should  
more correctly be referred to as electric potential. The  
difference in potential between two points is the potential  
difference (p.d.) between them.  
Just as with gravitational fields, we must define the zero  
of potential (this is the point where we consider a charge  
to have zero potential energy). Usually, in a laboratory  
situation, we define the Earth as being at a potential of  
zero volts. If we draw two parallel charged plates arranged  
horizontally, with the lower one earthed (Figure 23.8),  
you can see immediately how similar this is to our idea  
of gravitational fields. The diagram also shows how we  
can include equipotential lines in a representation of an  
electric field.

0 Distance in a uniform field.  
Figure 23.6 Work must be done to push one positive charge  
towards another.  
In the process of doing work, energy is transferred  
from you to the charge that you are pushing. Its potential  
energy increases. If you let go of the charge, it will move  
away from the repelling charge. This is analogous to lifting  
up a mass; it gains gravitational potential energy as you lift  
it, and it falls if you let go.  
Energy changes in a uniform field  
We can also think about moving a positive charge in a  
uniform electric field between two charged parallel plates.  
If we move the charge towards the positive plate, we have  
to do work. The potential energy of the charge is therefore  
increasing. If we move it towards the negative plate, its  
potential energy is decreasing (Figure 23.7a).  
Since the force is the same at all points in a uniform  
electric field, it follows that the energy of the charge

Imagine again pushing a small positive test charge towards  
a large positive charge. At first, the repulsive force is weak,  
and you have only to do a small amount of work. As you  
get closer, however, the force increases (Coulomb’s law),

This allows us to give a definition of electric potential:  
The electric potential at a point is equal to the work done  
in bringing unit positive charge from infinity to that point.  
Electric potential is a scalar quantity. To calculate the  
potential at a point caused by more than one charge, find

Capacitors  
Most electronic devices, such as radios, computers  
and MP3 players, make use of components called  
capacitors. These are usually quite small, but

constructed to store electrical energy at the  
Fermilab particle accelerator in the United States.

Capacitors in use  
Capacitors are used to store energy in electrical and metal plates  
electronic circuits. This means that they have many  
valuable applications. For example, capacitors are used  
in computers; they store energy in normal use, and then  
metal plates  
373  
they gradually release this energy if there is a power  
failure, so that the computer will operate long enough to dielectric  
save valuable data. The photograph (Figure 24.2) shows a  
lead

Figure 24.3 The construction of two types of capacitor.  
The two ammeters will give identical readings. The current  
stops when the potential difference (p.d.) across the  
capacitor is equal to the electromotive force (e.m.f.) of the  
supply. We then say that the capacitor is ‘fully charged’.

Every capacitor has two leads, each connected to a  
metal plate. To store energy, these two plates must be  
given equal and opposite electric charges. Between the  
plates is an insulating material called the dielectric. Figure  
24.3 shows a simplified version of the construction of a A A  
capacitor; in practice, many have a spiral ‘Swiss-roll’ form.  
To move charge onto the plates of a capacitor, it must  
be connected to a voltage supply. The negative terminal +Q –Q  
of the supply pushes electrons onto one plate, making it flow of  
negatively charged. Electrons are repelled from the other electrons

plate, making it positively charged. Figure 24.4 shows that  
there is a flow of electrons all the way round the circuit. Figure 24.4 The flow of charge when a capacitor is charged up.

Electronic devices are widespread in the modern  
world. From birth to death, electronic sensors watch  
over and control many of our environments. The  
chances of survival of the newborn baby in Figure

measures the temperature of the air. The output of the  
sensor operates heating and cooling devices which  
keep the temperature as constant as possible. Other  
sensors sound alarms if the baby’s breathing or heart  
rate falls to dangerous levels.  
In this chapter, we will explore how some common  
electronic sensors work. You will use what you have

BOX 25.1: Potential dividers in use  
Potential divider circuits are often used in electronic  
circuits. They are useful when a sensor is connected to a  
processing circuit. Suitable sensors include thermistors  
and light-dependent resistors (Figure 25.9). These can be  
used as sensors because:  
■■ the resistance of a negative temperature coefficient  
(NTC) thermistor decreases as its temperature increases  
■■ the resistance of a light-dependent resistor (LDR)  
decreases as the incident intensity of light increases.

You can make a magnetic field in two ways: using  
a permanent magnet, or using an electric current. You magnetic

An electromagnet makes use of the magnetic field  
created by an electric current (Figure 26.3a). A coil is

The magnetic field lines shown in Figure 26.4 are circular,  
centred on the long current-carrying wire. Further away  
end view  
from the wire, the field lines are drawn further apart,  
representing the weaker field at this distance. Reversing  
the current reverses the direction of the field.  
All magnetic fields are created by moving charges. (In  
the case of a wire, the moving charges are free electrons.)  
This is even true for a permanent bar magnet. In a  
permanent magnet, the magnetic field is produced by the  
movement of electrons within the atoms of the magnet.  
Each electron represents a tiny current as it circulates current  
around within its atom, and this current sets up a  
magnetic field. In a ferrous material such as iron, the weak  
fields due to all the electrons combine together to make a b  
strong field, which spreads out into the space beyond the  
magnet. In non-magnetic materials, the fields produced by  
the electrons cancel each other out. current  
Field direction  
The idea that magnetic field lines emerge from north poles  
and go into south poles is simply a convention. Figure 26.5 Figure 26.5 Two rules for determining the direction of a

The unit for magnetic flux density is the tesla, T. It follows  
from the equation for B that 1 T = 1 N A−1 m−1.  
The tesla is defined as follows:  
The magnetic flux density is 1 T when a wire carrying a  
current of 1 A placed at right angles to the magnetic field  
experiences a force of 1 N per metre of its length.

loop is 2.0 A. Calculate the torque that acts on the loop Step 2 Now we can calculate the force on one side of  
the loop using the equation F = BIL:

Now we must consider the situation where the current-

There are two ways to understand the origin of the forces 415  
between current-carrying conductors. In the first, we  
draw the magnetic fields around two current-carrying Figure 26.22 The forces between current-carrying wires.  
BOX 26.3: Observing the forces between currents  
You can observe the attraction and repulsion between  
two parallel currents using the equipment shown in  
Figure 26.23.  
Two long thin strips of aluminium foil are mounted  
so that they are parallel and a small distance apart. By  
connecting them in series with a power supply, you can  
make a current occur in both of them. By changing the  
connections, you can make the current first in the same  
direction through both strips (parallel currents) and  
then in opposite directions (anti-parallel currents).  
If you try this out, you will observe the strips of foil  
either bending towards each other or away from each  
current  
other. (Foil is used because it is much more flexible  
than wire.)  
You should find that parallel currents attract one  
another, while anti-parallel currents repel. This may  
seem surprising, since we are used to opposite charges  
attracting, and opposite magnetic poles attracting. Now

Most of the electricity we use is generated by  
electromagnetic induction. This process goes on in the  
generators at work in power stations, in wind turbines  
(Figure 28.1) and, on a much smaller scale, in bicycle  
dynamos. It is the process whereby a conductor and  
a magnetic field are moved relative to each other to  
induce, or generate, a current or electromotive force  
(e.m.f.).

coil. Hold it still, and then remove it. How does the  
microammeter  
deflection on the meter change? Try different speeds,

and the opposite pole of the magnet. Try weak and  
strong magnets.

the kinetic energy of the train can be used to turn the  
electric motor to generate an induced e.m.f. With the  
appropriate electronics the energy from the induced  
current can be passed back to the power supply that runs  
the train. This is an example of regenerative braking.  
Generators  
We can generate electricity by spinning a coil in a  
magnetic field. This is equivalent to using an electric  
motor backwards. Figure 28.26 shows such a coil in  
three different orientations as it spins. Notice that the  
rate of change of flux linkage is maximum when the coil  
is moving through the horizontal position – one side is  
cutting rapidly downwards through the field lines, the  
other is cutting rapidly upwards. In this position, we get a  
large induced e.m.f. As the coil moves through the vertical  
position, the rate of change of flux is zero – the sides of the  
coil are moving parallel to the field lines, not cutting them,

Another use of electromagnetic induction is in  
transformers. An alternating current is supplied to the  
primary coil and produces a varying magnetic field in the  
soft iron core (Figure 28.30). The secondary coil is also  
wound round this core, so the magnetic flux linking the  
secondary coil is constantly changing. Hence, according  
to Faraday’s law, a varying e.m.f. is induced across the  
secondary coil. The core is laminated – it is made up  
of thin sheets of soft iron. Using soft iron in the core  
increases the amount of the magnetic flux and, hopefully,  
all of the magnetic flux from the primary coil passes to  
the secondary coil. The thin sheets of iron in the core are

Figure 28.27 shows how the flux linkage varies with  
time for a rotating coil. According to Faraday’s law, the  
induced e.m.f. is equal to minus the gradient of the flux  
linkage against time graph.  
■■ When the flux linking the coil is maximum, the rate of  
change of flux is zero and hence the induced e.m.f. is zero.  
■■ When the flux linking the coil is zero, the rate of change  
of flux is maximum (the graph is steepest) and hence the  
induced e.m.f. is also maximum.  
Hence, for a coil like this we get a varying e.m.f. – this  
is how alternating current is generated. In practice,  
it is simpler to keep the large coil fixed and spin an  
electromagnet inside it (Figure 28.28). A bicycle generator  
(see Figure 28.7) is similar, but in this case a permanent  
magnet is made to spin inside a fixed coil. This makes for a  
very robust device.

Describing alternating current  
In developed countries, mains electricity is a supply  
of alternating current (a.c.). The first mains electricity  
supplies were developed towards the end of the 19th  
century; at that time, a great number of different  
voltages and frequencies were used in different places.  
In some places, the supply was direct current (d.c.).  
Nowadays this has been standardised across much of  
the world, with standard voltages of 110 V or 230 V (or  
similar), and frequencies of 50 Hz or 60 Hz.  
In this chapter we will look at some of the reasons  
why a.c. has been chosen as standard. First, however,  
we must take a close look at the nature of alternating Figure 29.1 Public electricity supplies made possible new

Measuring frequency and voltage  
An oscilloscope can be used to measure the frequency and  
voltage of an alternating current. Box 29.1 explains how to  
do this. There are two types of oscilloscope. The traditional  
cathode-ray oscilloscope (c.r.o.) uses an electron beam.  
The alternative is a digital oscilloscope, which is likely  
to be much more compact and which can store data and  
display the traces later.

BOX 29.2: Comparing a.c. and d.c  
Because power supplied by an alternating current to an a.c. supply (on the right) and the other to a d.c.  
is varying all the time, we need to have some way of supply (the batteries on the left ). The a.c. supply is  
describing the average power which is being supplied. To adjusted so that the two lamps are equally bright,  
do this, we compare an alternating current with a direct indicating that the two supplies are providing energy  
current, and try to find the direct current that supplies at the same average rate. The output voltages are then  
the same average power as the alternating current. compared on the double-beam oscilloscope.

Two lamps are placed side by side; one is connected that the a.c. trace sometimes rises above the steady d.c.  
trace, and sometimes falls below it. This makes sense:  
sometimes the a.c. is delivering more power than the  
d.c., and sometimes less, but the average power is the  
same for both.

smaller the current, the smaller the losses. This is illustrated in two ways. Firstly, it costs money to generate power  
in Worked example 2. because of the fuel needed. Secondly, more power stations  
are required, and power stations are expensive. The use  
of transformers to transform power to high voltages saves  
a few per cent of a national bill for electrical power, and  
means that fewer expensive power stations are needed.  
It is claimed that having a few, very large power  
stations gives economies of scale, but this is debated by  
many environmentalists who would prefer to see many  
small, local power stations. It is also the case that new  
developments in technology are making it easier to  
transform direct current to high voltages. This is more  
compatible with sustainable electricity generating systems  
such as photovoltaics (solar cells), so we may see the  
development of d.c. grid systems in the near future.

What is light?  
When the first laser was made in 1960, it seemed like  
a clever idea, but it was a long time before it found  
any useful application. Today, lasers are everywhere  
– in CD and DVD machines, computer disc drives,  
supermarket barcode scanners – there are probably  
more lasers than people. Figure 30.1 shows a patient  
undergoing laser eye surgery.  
The invention of the laser was only possible when  
scientists had cracked the mystery of the nature of  
light. Does light behave as particles or as waves? As we  
shall see in this chapter, the answer is – a bit of both.

Modelling with particles and  
waves  
In this chapter, we will study two very powerful scientific  
models – particles and waves – to see how they can help us 467  
to understand more about both light and matter. First we  
will take a closer look at each of these models in turn.  
Particle models  
In order to explain the properties of matter, we often think  
about the particles of which it is made and the ways in  
which they behave. We imagine particles as being objects  
that are hard, have mass and move about according to the  
laws of Newtonian mechanics (Figure 30.2). When two  
particles collide, we can predict how they will move after the  
collision, based on knowledge of their masses and velocities  
before the collision. If you have played snooker or pool, you  
will have a pretty good idea of how particles behave.  
Particles are a macroscopic model. Our ideas of  
particles come from what we observe on a macroscopic  
scale – when we are walking down the street, or observing

BOX 30.2: Observing the photoelectric effect  
You can observe the photoelectric effect yourself  
by fixing a clean zinc plate to the top of a gold-leaf mercury  
electroscope (Figure 30.7). Give the electroscope lamp  
a negative charge and the leaf deflects. Now shine zinc plate  
electromagnetic radiation from a mercury discharge  
lamp on the zinc and the leaf gradually falls. (A  
mercury lamp strongly emits ultraviolet radiation.)  
Charging the electroscope gives it an excess of  
electrons. Somehow, the electromagnetic radiation  
from the mercury lamp helps electrons to escape  
from the surface of the metal.  
Placing the mercury lamp closer causes the leaf to  
fall more rapidly. This is not very surprising. However,  
if you insert a sheet of glass between the lamp and  
the zinc, the radiation from the lamp is no longer

BOX 30.3: Investigating electron diffraction  
If you have access to an electron diffraction tube  
(Figure 30.25), you can see for yourself how a beam  
of electrons is diffracted. The electron gun at one  
end of the tube produces a beam of electrons.  
By changing the voltage between the anode and  
the cathode, you can change the energy of the  
electrons, and hence their speed. The beam strikes a  
graphite target, and a diffraction pattern appears on  
the screen at the other end of the tube.

Energy and the nucleus  
Towards the end of the Second World War, nuclear  
weapons were dropped on the Japanese cities of  
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nuclear explosions release  
so much energy that their size is often given in  
‘megatonnes’ – that is, their equivalent in millions  
of tonnes of high explosive (Figure 31.1). A more  
peaceful use of nuclear materials is in nuclear power  
generation. Because materials such as uranium are  
such concentrated stores of energy, a nuclear power  
station requires only a small van-load of fuel each  
week, whereas a coal-fired power station may require  
a train-load every hour.  
In this chapter, we will look at energy in the atomic  
nucleus and how this relates to nuclear stability;

Balanced equations  
When an unstable nucleus undergoes radioactive decay,  
the nucleus before the decay is often referred to as the  
490 parent nucleus and the new nucleus after the decay of the  
α-particle is known as the daughter nucleus.  
Radioactive decay processes can be represented by  
balanced equations. As with all equations representing  
nuclear processes, both nucleon number A and proton  
number Z are conserved.  
■■ In α decay, the nucleon number decreases by 4 and  
the proton number decreases by 2.  
■■ In β− decay, the nucleon number is unchanged and  
the proton number increases by 1.  
■■ In β+ decay, the nucleon number is unchanged and  
the proton number decreases by 1.  
■■ In γ emission there is no change in nucleon or proton  
number.

Fusion  
Fusion is the process by which two very light nuclei join  
together to form a heavier nucleus. (This is the process by  
which energy is released in the Sun, when hydrogen nuclei  
fuse to form helium nuclei.) If two light nuclei fuse, the final  
binding energy per nucleon will be greater than the original

10 The mass of a 8 4 Be nucleus is 1.33 × 10−26 kg.

Be, determine:

b the binding energy  
c the binding energy per nucleon.  
Binding energy, fission and fusion  
We can use the binding energy graph to help us decide  
which nuclear processes – fission, fusion, radioactive decay  
– are likely to occur (Figure 31.6).  
Fission  
Fission is the process in which a massive nucleus splits to  
496  
form two smaller fragments (rather than simply emitting  
α- or β-radiation). For uranium, we have A = 235, and the  
typical fragments have A = 140 and 95. If we look at the  
binding energy curve, we see that these two fragments  
have greater binding energy (less potential energy) per  
nucleon than the original uranium nucleus. Hence, if the  
uranium nucleus splits in this way, energy will be released.

### QUESTIONS

### QUESTION

11 Use the binding energy graph to suggest why  
fission is unlikely to occur with ‘light nuclei’  
(A < 20), and why fusion is unlikely to occur for  
heavier nuclei (A > 40).  
Randomness and decay  
Listen to a counter connected to a Geiger–Müller (GM)  
tube that is detecting the radiation from a weak source,  
so that the count rate is about one count per second. Each  
count represents the detection of a single α-particle or  
a β-particle or a γ-ray photon. You will notice that the  
individual counts do not come regularly. The counter  
beeps or clicks in a random, irregular manner. If you try to  
predict when the next clicks will come, you are unlikely to  
be right.  
You can see the same effect if you have a ratemeter,  
which can measure faster rates (Figure 31.7). The needle  
fluctuates up and down. Usually a ratemeter has a control  
for setting the ‘time constant’ – the time over which the  
meter averages out the fluctuations. Usually this can be set  
to 1 s or 5 s. The fluctuations are smoothed out more on the  
5 s setting.

Figure 31.8 shows a graph of count rate against existed for billions of years, and will still exist long after  
time, with a smoothing of a few seconds. The count rate we are gone. The nucleus of an atom does not age.  
decreases with time as the number of radioactive nuclei If we look at a very large number of atoms of a  
that are left decreases. The fluctuations either side are radioactive substance, we will see that the number of  
caused by the randomness of the decay. undecayed nuclei gradually decreases. However, we  
cannot predict when an individual nucleus will decay.  
Each nucleus ‘makes up its own mind’ when to decay,  
independently from its neighbours. This is because  
neighbouring nuclei do not interact with one another  
(unlike neighbouring atoms). The nucleus is a tiny fraction  
of the size of the atom, and the nuclear forces do not  
extend very far outside the nucleus. So one nucleus cannot  
affect a neighbouring nucleus by means of the nuclear  
force. Being inside a nucleus is a bit like living in a house  
in the middle of nowhere; you can just see out into the  
garden, but everything is darkness beyond, and the next  
0 50 100 150 house is 1000 km away.  
Time / s The fact that individual nuclei decay spontaneously,  
and independently of their neighbours and of  
environmental factors, accounts for the random pattern  
of clicks that we hear from a Geiger counter and the  
fluctuations of the needle on the ratemeter.  
To summarise, nuclear decay is spontaneous because:  
■■ the decay of a particular nucleus is not affected by the 497  
presence of other nuclei  
■■ the decay of nuclei cannot be affected by chemical  
reactions or external factors such as temperature and  
pressure.  
Nuclear decay is random because:  
■■ it is impossible to predict when a particular nucleus in a  
sample is going to decay  
■■ each nucleus in a sample has the same chance of decaying  
per unit time.  
The mathematics of radioactive  
decay  
We have seen that radioactive decay is a random,  
spontaneous process. Because we cannot say when an  
individual nucleus will decay, we have to start thinking  
about very large numbers of nuclei. Even a tiny speck of  
radioactive material will contain more than 1015 nuclei.  
Then we can talk about the average number of nuclei that  
we expect to decay in a particular time interval; in other  
words, we can find out the average decay rate. Although  
we cannot make predictions for individual nuclei, we can  
say that certain types of nuclei are more likely to decay  
than others. For example, a nucleus of carbon-12 is stable;  
carbon-14 decays gradually over thousands of years;  
carbon-15 nuclei last, on average, a few seconds.  
etar  
tnuoC  
Figure 31.8 Count rate showing randomness of decay.  
So it is apparent that radioactive decay is a random,  
irregular phenomenon. But is it completely unpredictable?  
Well, not really. We can measure the average rate of decay.  
We might measure the number of counts detected in  
1000 s, and then calculate the average number per second.  
We cannot be sure about this average rate either, because  
the number of counts in 1000 s will fluctuate, too. All of  
our measurements of radioactive decay are inherently  
uncertain and imprecise but, by taking averages over a  
sufficiently long time period, we can reduce or smooth out  
the random fluctuations to reveal the underlying pattern.  
Spontaneous decay  
Radioactive decay occurs within the unstable nucleus  
of an atom. A nucleus emits radiation and becomes  
the nucleus of an atom of a different element. This is a  
spontaneous process, which means that we cannot predict,  
for a particular nucleus, when it will happen. If we sit and  
stare at an individual nucleus, we cannot see any change  
that will tell us that it is getting ready to decay. And if it  
doesn’t decay in the first hour when we are watching it, we  
cannot say that it is any more likely to decay in the next  
hour. What is more, we cannot affect the probability of an  
individual nucleus decaying, for example by changing its  
temperature.  
This is slightly odd, because it goes against our  
everyday experience of the way things around us change.  
We observe things changing. They gradually age, die, rot  
away. But this is not how things are on the scale of atoms  
and nuclei. Many of the atoms of which we are made have

experiment, the more reliable our answer will be.) ∆N = 2.8 × 107 × 120 = 3.36 × 109 ≈ 3.4 × 109  
We can now define the decay constant:

Step 1 Since activity A = −λN, we have:

Note that, because we are measuring the probability of

day−1, year−1, etc.).  
The activity of the sample would then be:  
The activity of a source is defined as follows:  
A = 0.2 × 800 = 160 s−1 = 160 Bq  
(In fact, it would be slightly higher than this. Since the

Activity is measured in decays per second (or h−1, day−1).

Decay graphs and equations  
The activity of a radioactive substance gradually  
diminishes as time goes by. The atomic nuclei emit  
radiation and become different substances. The pattern  
499  
of radioactive decay is an example of a very important  
pattern found in many different situations, a pattern called  
exponential decay. Figure 31.9 shows the decay graphs for  
three different isotopes, each with a different rate of decay.

Although the three graphs look different, they all have  
something in common − their shape. They are curved lines  
having a special property. If you know what is meant by  
the half-life of a radioisotope, then you will understand  
what is special about the shape of these curves.

Figure 31.10 All radioactive decay graphs have the same  
characteristic shape.  
In principle, the graph never reaches zero; it just gets  
closer and closer. In practice, when only a few undecayed  
nuclei remain the graph will cease to be a smooth curve  
(because of the random nature of the decay) and it will  
eventually reach zero. We use the idea of half-life because  
we cannot say when a sample will have completely  
decayed.  
Mathematical decay  
We can write an equation to represent the graph shown in  
Figure 31.10. If we start with N undecayed nuclei, then the  
0  
number N that remain undecayed after time t is given by:  
N = N e(−λt)  
0  
In this equation, λ is the decay constant, as before. (You  
may also see this written as N = N exp (−λt).) Note that

you must take care with units. If λ is in s−1, then the time t  
must be in s.  
The symbol e represents the number e = 2.71828…,  
a special number in the same way that π is a special  
number. You will need to be able to use the ex key on your  
calculator to solve problems involving e.  
The activity A of a sample is proportional to the  
number of undecayed nuclei N. Hence the activity of the  
sample decreases exponentially:  
A = A e(−λt)

ideas keep reappearing – for example, the idea of a field  
of force (magnetic, electric, gravitational), or the idea  
of energy transmitted as waves, or the idea that matter

This is an important characteristic of physics; ideas  
that are used in one area prove to be useful in another.  
Hopefully, you will see many of these connections now  
that you are approaching the end of your course.  
Physics is also useful. It is applied in many  
areas of life. In this chapter, we look at one of these Figure 32.1 A radiographer and a doctor examine X-ray

X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation. They The X-rays used in medical applications are usually  
belong to the short-wavelength, high-frequency end of the described as soft X-rays, because their energy is not very

to 10−13 m and are effectively the same as gamma-rays As with all electromagnetic radiation, we can think  
(γ-rays), the difference being in the way they are produced: of X-rays either as waves or as photons (see Chapter 30).  
X-rays travel in straight lines through a uniform medium.  
■■ X-rays are produced when fast-moving electrons are rapidly  
decelerated. As the electrons slow down, their kinetic

energy is transformed to photons of electromagnetic  
radiation. Figure 32.3a shows a patient undergoing a pelvic X-ray to

form of X-ray photons, which emerge in all directions.  
Part of the outer casing, the window, is thinner than the  
rest and allows X-rays to emerge into the space outside the  
b  
tube. The width of the X-ray beam can be controlled using  
metal tubes beyond the window to absorb X-rays. This  
produces a parallel-sided beam called a collimated beam.  
Only a small fraction, about 1%, of the kinetic energy  
of the electrons is converted to X-rays. Most of the incident  
energy is transferred to the anode, which becomes hot. This  
508  
explains why the anode rotates; the region that is heated  
turns out of the beam so that it can cool down by radiating  
heat to its surroundings. Some X-ray tubes have water  
circulating through the anode to remove this excess heat.

Figure 32.4 shows the principles of the modern X-ray X-rays  
tube. The tube itself is evacuated, and contains two  
electrodes:  
■■ Cathode – the heated filament acts as the cathode  
(negative) from which electrons are emitted.  
■■ Anode – the rotating anode (positive) is made of a hard  
metal such as tungsten. (The anode metal is often referred  
to as the ‘target metal’.)  
An external power supply produces a voltage of up to  
200 kV between the two electrodes. This accelerates a beam  
of electrons across the gap between the cathode and the  
anode. The kinetic energy of an electron arriving at the  
anode is 200 keV. When the electrons strike the anode at  
high speed, they lose some of their kinetic energy in the

Decreasing intensity  
You should recall from Chapter 13 that the intensity of  
a beam of radiation indicates the rate at which energy is  
transferred across unit cross-sectional area. Intensity is  
defined thus:  
Intensity is the power per unit cross-sectional area.  
We can determine the intensity I using the equation:  
### P

### I =

### A

where P is power and A is the cross-sectional area normal  
to the radiation. The unit of intensity is W m−2.  
The intensity of a collimated beam of X-rays (i.e. a beam  
with parallel sides, so that it does not spread out) decreases  
as it passes through matter. Picture a beam entering a block  
of material. Suppose that, after it has passed through 1 cm  
of material, its intensity has decreased to half its original  
value. Then, after it has passed through 2 cm, the intensity  
will have decreased to one quarter of its original value (half  
of a half), and then after 3 cm it will be reduced to one  
eighth. You should recognise this pattern (1, 1  
2  
, 1

, 1

, …) as a  
510  
form of exponential decay.  
We can write an equation to represent the attenuation of  
X-rays as they pass through a uniform material as follows:  
I = I e−µx 0  
where I is the initial intensity (before absorption), x is  
0  
the thickness of the material, I is the transmitted intensity  
and µ is the attenuation (or absorption) coefficient of the  
material. Figure 32.6 shows this pattern of absorption. It  
also shows that bone is a better absorber of X-rays than  
flesh; it has a higher attenuation coefficient. (The attenuation  
coefficient also depends on the energy of the X-ray photons.)  
The unit of the attenuation coefficient µ is m−1 (or cm−1  
etc.).  
Now look at Worked example 1.

0  
half-thickness x is related to the attenuation

area of 5.0 cm2 each second. Calculate its intensity  
in W m−2.  
5 An X-ray beam of initial intensity 50 W m−2 is incident  
on soft tissue of attenuation coefficient 1.2 cm−1.  
Calculate its intensity after it has passed through a  
5.0 cm thickness of tissue.

### WORKED EXAMPLE

1 The attenuation (absorption) coefficient of bone is  
600 m−1 for X-rays of energy 20 keV. A beam of such  
X-rays has an intensity of 20 W m−2. Calculate the  
intensity of the beam after passing through a 4.0 mm  
thickness of bone.  
Step 1 Write down the quantities that you are given;  
make sure that the units are consistent.  
I = 20 W m−2  
0  
x = 4.0 mm = 0.004 m  
µ = 600 m−1  
Step 2 Substitute in the equation for intensity and  
solve.  
Hint: Calculate the exponent (the value of –µx) first.  
I = I e−µx  
0  
= 20 × e−(600 × 0.04) = 20 × e−2.4  
= 1.8 W m−2  
So the intensity of the X-ray beam will have been  
reduced to about 10% of its initial value after passing  
through just 4.0 mm of bone.  
Half thickness  
If we compare the graphs (or equations) for the attenuation  
of X-rays as they pass through a material with the decay of  
a radioactive nuclide we see that they are both exponential  
decays. From Chapter 31, you should become familiar  
with the concept of the half-life of a radioactive isotope  
(the time taken for half the nuclei in any sample of the  
isotope to decay). In a similar manner we refer to the half-  
thickness of an absorbing material. This is the thickness  
of material which will reduce the transmitted intensity  
of an X-ray beam of a particular frequency to half its  
original value.

is kept to a minimum.  
A radiographer may choose to record the X-ray image  
on film or digitally. X-rays are only weakly absorbed  
by photographic film, so, historically, patients had to  
be exposed to long and intense doses of X-rays. Today, 511  
intensifier screens are used. These are sheets of a  
material that contains a phosphor, a substance that emits  
visible light when it absorbs X-ray photons. The film is  
sandwiched between two intensifier screens. Each X-ray  
photon absorbed results in several thousand light photons,  
which then blacken the film. This reduces the patient’s  
exposure by a factor of 100–500.  
In digital systems, image intensifiers are used  
(Figure 32.7). The incoming X-rays strike a phosphor  
screen, producing visible light photons. These then  
release electrons (by the photoelectric effect) from the  
photocathode. The electrons are accelerated and focused  
by the positively charged anode so that they strike a  
screen, which then gives out visible light. The image on

Ultrasound scanning  
There are several different types of ultrasound scan which  
are used in practice. To illustrate the basic principles, we  
will concentrate on the A-scan and the B-scan.  
A-scan  
This is the simplest type of scan. A pulse of ultrasound is  
sent into the body and the reflected ‘echoes’ are detected  
and displayed on an oscilloscope or computer screen as a  
voltage–time graph.  
A pulse generator controls the ultrasound transducer.  
It is also connected to the time base of the oscilloscope.  
Simultaneously, the pulse generator triggers a pulse of  
ultrasound which travels into the patient and starts a trace

Procedure  
The patient lies on a bed which is moved into the centre of  
the electromagnet. The central imaging section is about  
0.9 m long and 0.6 m in diameter. The magnetic field is  
very uniform, with variations smaller than 50 parts per  
million in its strength. The gradient field is superimposed  
on this fixed field. An RF pulse is then transmitted into

receiving coils pick up the relaxation signal and pass it to  
the computer.  
MRI scanner  
Figure 32.34 shows the main components of an MRI  
scanner. The main features are:  
■■ A large superconducting magnet which produces the  
external magnetic field (up to 2.0 T) needed to align the  
protons. Superconducting magnets are cooled to 4.2 K  
(−269 °C) using liquid helium.  
■■ An RF coil that transmits RF pulses into the body.  
■■ An RF coil that detects the signal emitted by the relaxing  
protons.  
■■ A set of gradient coils. (For clarity, only one pair of gradient  
coils is shown in Figure 32.34.) These produce an additional  
external magnetic field that varies across the patient’s  
body. These coils are arranged such that they alter the  
magnitude of the magnetic flux density across the length,  
depth and width of the patient. This ensures that the  
Larmor frequency of the nuclei within the patient will be Figure 32.35 MRI scan through a healthy human head.

The result is an image like the one shown in Figure

relaxation times.  
Advantages and disadvantages of MRI  
MRI has several advantages compared to other scanning  
techniques:  
■■ It does not use ionising radiation which causes a hazard to  
patients and staff.  
■■ There are no moving mechanisms, just changing currents  
and magnetic fields.  
■■ The patient feels nothing during a scan (although the  
gradient coils are noisy as they are switched), and there are  
no after-effects.  
■■ MRI gives better soft-tissue contrast than a CT scan,  
although it does not show bone as clearly.  
■■ Computer images can be generated showing any section  
through the volume scanned, or as a three-dimensional Figure 32.36 A combined CT scan and MRI scan, showing how  
image. the tissues revealed by MRI relate to the bone structure shown  
by X-rays.  
One disadvantage of MRI is that any metallic objects in  
the patient, such as surgical pins, can become heated.  
Also, heart pacemakers can be affected, so patients with QUESTION  
such items cannot undergo MRI scans. Loose steel objects

Consider the equation: y = ax n 8.0  
Taking logarithms of both sides gives:

ln y = ln a + n ln x  
Now consider the equation: y = aekx  
Taking logarithms of both sides gives:  
ln y = ln a + kx

Which graph to plot?  
In handling data, our aim is usually to process the data to  
obtain a straight line graph. Then we can deduce quantities  
from the gradient and the intercepts. Table P2.1 shows  
graphs which can be plotted for different relationships,  
and the quantities which can be deduced from the graphs.

Uncertainties and graphs  
We can use error bars to show uncertainties on graphs.

a spring.

When plotting the graph, the points are plotted as usual,  
and then they are extended to show the maximum and  
minimum likely values, as shown in Figure P2.7. Then the  
best fit line is drawn.  
To estimate the error in the gradient we draw not only the  
best fit line but also a ‘worst acceptable’ line, passing through  
the extremes in the error bars as shown in Figure P2.8.  
The gradients for both best fit and worst fit lines are  
calculated and the error is the difference in their gradients:

1.00 ± 0.02 ms. The first image of the bullet on the  
photograph appears to be at a position of  
22.5 ± 0.5 cm on a scale underneath the flight  
path. The position of the second image is  
37.5 ± 0.7 cm on the same scale. Find the speed of  
the bullet and its absolute uncertainty.

In our experiment, the gradients are:  
8.2 − 0  
line of best fit: gradient = cm N−1  
5.0 − 0  
= 1.64 cm N−1 ≈ 1.6 cm N−1  
7.6 − 0.6  
line of worst fit: gradient = cm N−1  
5.0 − 0  
= 1.4 cm N−1  
So the uncertainty in the gradient = 1.6 − 1.4 = ± 0.2 cm N−1  
The gradient is therefore: 1.6 ± 0.2 cm N−1.

Advice on how to revise for and  
approach examinations  
Tips for revision  
Know the syllabus  
The Cambridge International AS and A Level Physics syllabus is divided into sections; each section is  
divided into Learning outcomes. The advice here refers to both the AS and A Level examinations. It  
is useful to familiarise yourself with what you are expected to know for examination. You can access  
a copy of the syllabus on the Cambridge International Examinations website, and you should always  
refer to the syllabus for the specific year you are entering the examination. Your class notes may  
contain extra background information to help you understand topics. Use the syllabus to refer to the  
Learning outcomes and then extract the relevant points from class notes when you make learning  
notes (see below) and revision notes.  
When planning your revision, allocate your revision time according to:  
■■ the amount of material you need to learn  
■■ how difficult each section has been for you.  
Learn the wording of any Learning outcomes that are definitions of scientific terms, and learn  
any basic proofs that are required in the Learning outcomes – these could form the basis of some  
questions. Remember to use ‘per’ in a definition if a ratio is used; for example, pressure is defined  
as force per unit area, and not force on unit area. However, it is very important not to simply learn  
the material by rote, but to be able to apply your learning to usual and unusual situations, as exam  
questions can present you with a situation in a new context.  
Make learning notes  
Many students learn by repetition. As you learn, you can reduce your class notes:  
class notes → learning notes → revision notes  
Each time you complete a topic, it’s helpful to go back through your class notes and organise them in  
a way that suits your style of learning, to make your learning notes. Learning notes are personal and  
individual to you and will emphasise anything that you have found difficult.  
You can benefit from rewriting class notes using strategies that work for you – for example, with  
colours, flow diagrams, bullet points or concept maps, in any way that you find helpful and even  
humorous. Check your notes against the coursebook and leave out, or reduce to a minimum, any  
points with which you are thoroughly familiar. Include equations.  
To make learning notes:  
■■ produce a shortened version of your class notes  
■■ check your class notes against your coursebook  
■■ leave out background, non-syllabus information  
■■ leave out, or reduce to a minimum, points that you know you will never forget; for example, you  
know from earlier courses, such as the IGCSE®, the properties of magnets and magnetic fields, but  
a new formula such as F = BIL sin θ needs to be emphasised  
■■ avoid long, flowing sentences that contain many points  
■■ use bullet points or short sentences, each containing one or two points that are likely to gain  
marks in an exam – ‘mark points’

■■ use scientific terminology correctly and as specifically as you can.  
Your teacher may have covered topics in a different order from that in the published syllabus. This  
may also be a logical order for you. Make your learning notes for each topic on separate pieces of  
paper to put into your folder in your preferred order.  
Making learning notes has benefits:  
■■ repeating and reformatting class notes helps learning  
■■ it is a first stage in revision for the exams  
■■ notes are in your preferred style to optimise learning  
■■ you can assess how well you understand each Learning outcome.  
Make revision notes  
It is likely that you will be trying to cope with other subjects as the exam time approaches, so you can  
reduce your notes further to make revision notes:  
class notes → learning notes → revision notes  
Revision notes should contain only the detail necessary to get your very best grade. Think about  
how you will set out these notes and discuss them with your friends. Make your revision productive  
by making it interesting and fun. Make notes, revision cards or topic maps. Revision should be an  
active process, i.e. you should be ‘doing things’, not just sitting and reading a book. Revise with a  
friend so that you can test each other, or try explaining the physics of a topic to a friend – as if you  
were a teacher! Try not to copy directly from the coursebook or syllabus, but put the ideas in your  
own words, checking them later. At this stage you should incorporate your experience of practice  
questions and their mark schemes from past papers.  
You might try another process. Using the syllabus as your starting point:  
1 Write down on a sheet of paper or card each definition, law and equation. Some equations will be  
given to you on the examination paper, but you must still learn what the letters stand for, and the  
units.  
2 On another sheet or card, write down the title of each important experiment.  
3 On a third sheet, write down the title for each important idea that you need to understand  
(e.g. the difference between AM and FM modulation).  
4 On the next sheet, write down any parts of the syllabus you do not understand.  
Now, with your sheets or cards labelled 1, 2, 3 or 4, you should:  
1 Write out the definitions, laws and equations from your own memory. Tick each one off when  
you are sure you know it and it is the same as in your notes or in the coursebook.  
2 Test your knowledge by drawing a clearly labelled diagram, listing the readings taken and  
explaining the conclusion. Go back to the page in your notes or the coursebook to check.  
$3 Test your understanding by drawing labelled diagrams and/or brief notes. Go back to the page in$  
your notes or coursebook to check.  
4 Seek help! Ask your teacher, or read the coursebook.

Know what to expect for each exam  
Before you enter the exam room, you should know what to expect in the exam paper you are facing.  
Exam papers have different types of questions, including multiple choice questions, structured  
questions and practical questions. It is important to know how long the exam lasts and how many  
questions you need to answer. You can find this information in the syllabus.  
The table below, based on the latest syllabus, shows the types of questions in each of the Cambridge  
International Examinations papers.  
Paper Level Type of paper and questions it contains  
1 AS written; multiple choice questions  
2 AS written; structured questions  
3 AS practical; testing skills such as manipulation, measurement and observation, presentation of  
data and observations, analysis, conclusions and evaluation  
4 A written; structured questions  
5 A written; testing the practical skills of planning, analysis and evaluation  
Apart from multiple choice questions, it is rare for questions to be worded as straightforward  
questions with question marks. They generally have command terms. A list with explanations of the  
most common command terms that you should understand is in the syllabus. The most common  
terms are: state, describe, explain and calculate. Make sure you know exactly what is required for  
each command term. For example, there is no point in writing a long explanation of why something  
happens if the question merely asks you to state what happens.  
Use past papers to help you revise  
You will find it helpful to look at or practise past exam papers.  
You will also need to learn and practise the practical skills that are tested in the AS practical  
examination and the A Level paper that concentrates on the skills of planning, analysis and  
evaluation.  
Your teacher may have copies of past papers and mark schemes.  
Approaching the examinations  
Make sure that you know about the data and formulae given at the front of the question paper. You  
should be so familiar with this data and these formulae that you almost do not need to look them  
up, but it is better to refresh your memory each time that you use an equation, to check that you  
have not made a mistake in writing down a formula or have used a wrong power of ten in a constant.  
Suggestions on how to approach multiple choice question papers  
Understanding multiple choice questions  
Each question may be posed on its own or may be preceded by some information. There are four  
answer options: A, B, C and D. You must choose the one that is the correct answer.  
Some questions have a simple construction in which the options A, B, C and D appear directly below  
the question. The options could be one or more sentences long. Other questions have a construction  
in which each option is a row in a headed table.

During the exam  
When tackling questions:  
■■ read questions through more than once  
■■ check whether a positive or negative answer is being asked for, e.g. whether the question says  
‘which of the following is ...?’ or, ‘is not …?’; for example, when asked for an incorrect ray diagram,  
be careful not to pick a correct diagram as your answer  
■■ underline or circle important information in the stem of the question to help you understand the  
important points  
■■ never leave a question unanswered; marks are not deducted for incorrect answers  
■■ try to eliminate some of the possible answers if you are not sure of the answer  
■■ write out your working to numerical questions clearly (on the question paper in the space  
provided near the question) so you can check it later; do not try to do all the working in your  
head, as you are likely to make mistakes  
■■ if option A appears to be correct, read on and check the others before you confirm your choice  
■■ do not look at the pattern of answers on the answer sheet to predict the correct option – you  
should not expect there to be an equal number of correct option letters in the whole exam;  
likewise, if the last answer was an A, you cannot assume that the next one must be a B, C or D, for  
example. For questions that assess topics which you find difficult, try to recall the relevant section  
of your revision notes before looking at the options (A, B, C and D) available.  
Suggestions on how to approach papers with structured questions  
During a ‘real’ examination is not the time to work out your preferred strategy for coping with  
structured questions in exam papers. If you can, practise beforehand by using, for example, past  
papers, and try different exam approaches to see what is best for you.  
Exam papers aren’t long enough to test your knowledge and understanding of all the Learning  
outcomes. Ensure that you have revised well and are prepared for your less-favourite topics to turn  
up in the exam. In both of the structured-question papers, each main question can assess Learning  
outcomes from more than one syllabus section.  
Approaching the exam paper  
The first question in a structured-question paper is sometimes slightly easier, so it can be completed  
with relative ease and gives you confidence. However, make sure that you read through all of the  
questions thoroughly and then decide which question to tackle first. You should monitor the time  
that you spend on each question throughout any paper and adjust your working accordingly. This  
will ensure that towards the end of the examination you will have sufficient time to finish. Practise  
with past papers under timed conditions to develop your timing skills.  
Always show your working when answering a question. You must include the method as well as the  
answer, and show every step in each calculation. It is also true that you should not give up on any  
question, but should show what you can do, even if you cannot work the question through to the end.  
In calculations, it is best to start by writing down the equation that you will use, then substitute the  
values in another written expression, and finally give the answer. All of these stages should appear.  
During the calculation do not prematurely round your answer, and always keep and use more  
significant figures than are given in the question. You can round your answer at the end, but make  
sure you do so correctly: for example, 1.86 is 1.9 to two significant figures, not 1.8. Always use g as  
9.81 m s–2 and not 10 m s–2. Check that the units you have used are consistent; for example, if the  
distance is given in km and the speed is given in m s−1, then you must convert km to m.

When you have obtained the final answer, make sure that:  
■■ it is a sensible and realistic number; for example, if you have worked out the current in a wire to  
be 3 000 000 A, then this is likely to be wrong and you should look for the mistake  
■■ it has units; look out, in particular, for questions that ask you to give the units of your answer or  
that do not have the units on the answer line  
■■ it has the correct number of significant figures; this should be the least number of significant figures  
in the data in the question – this data is often given to two or three significant figures, so if you write  
your answer down to one or to four or more figures, then you should have a good reason. Think very  
carefully indeed before you write down all the figures you see on your calculator!  
If you have difficulty in giving an answer in writing, then provide a sketch or diagram; this is  
sometimes much easier than using many words. Diagrams or sketches should always be labelled  
with as much detail as you can. Try to make your explanations as clear as possible and use technical  
terms correctly; for example, it is better to say ‘resistance is inversely proportional to area’ than ‘as  
area increases resistance decreases’. Sketch graphs should have their axes labelled, and the values of  
any important points on the axes should be shown, particularly the origin.  
Some questions require longer written answers. Before you start these questions, look at the  
number of marks that they are worth. This will help you decide how many important points you  
should include in your answer. Then it is best to briefly plan the structure of your answer before  
starting to write. If there are three marks for the question, then include at least three different and  
valid points if you can. You do not need to start your answer by rewriting the question itself because  
then there may be too little space left for your answer.  
Suggestions on how to approach practical papers  
Practical examination papers  
Read through each question carefully before you start to take any readings. Do not worry if you  
have never met the experiment before or if it contains unusual apparatus. The question paper itself  
should tell you what to do, and you must follow the instructions that you are given.  
If there is a problem with your apparatus, for example the power supply does not work, then you can  
ask the supervisor for help. You may lose some marks if the supervisor has to set the apparatus up  
for you, but not if there was a genuine failure in the apparatus.  
The syllabus gives a lot of information on the skills that you will need. Many of these skills are  
straightforward but may not be clear from the instructions for the examination. For example, you  
should choose values for the independent variable that:  
■■ cover the largest possible range of readings that can be obtained using the apparatus, or that are  
consistent with the instructions given  
■■ give, ideally, an even spread of readings across the range.  
For example, if you are asked to measure the resistance of a wire for five different lengths and the  
wire is stretched along a metre rule, you would not choose to measure lengths of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm  
or 10, 20, 30, 40 and 100 cm, but you might suggest 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 cm.  
You may be asked to make a table of your readings. It is best to plan this and to draw the columns  
and headings before you take any readings. Then, as you take each reading you can enter it directly  
into the table. This will save time.  
Before you start:  
■■ look through the question to see whether you need a column for a derived quantity as well the  
columns for the readings themselves  
■■ think about which readings you will repeat.

For example, if you are measuring the resistance of different lengths of wire, you may record the  
value of current and voltage twice and calculate the resistance for each length twice. This means  
that the column for resistance has to have three small sections, two for the values of resistance and  
one for the average. Do not waste time taking readings more than once unless you are asked to do  
so. Thus the column headings and first row of your table might be:  
Length / cm Reading 1 Reading 2 Resistance / Ω  
Current / A Voltage / V Current / A Voltage / V Reading 1 Reading 2 Average  
10.0 1.20 3.45 1.22 3.50 2.88 2.87 2.87  
Make sure that each column has a quantity and a unit.  
All the readings in a particular column should be recorded to the same number of decimal places,  
corresponding to the precision of the instrument that you are using. In the example above, every  
current recorded should be to the nearest 0.01 A if that is the smallest division on the instrument. If the  
current happens to be 1.20, do not just write down 1.2, as there will be other currents such as 1.51 that  
have a different number of decimal places.  
In the example above, notice that the length was written as 10.0 cm, as it is possible to measure to  
1 mm on a rule. Of course the uncertainty in a reading can be larger than the smallest division on the  
instrument and the ammeter readings may be fluctuating by more than 0.01 A. It is usually best to  
write down what you see on the instrument. Sometimes the readings will differ when repeated, due  
to random error.  
The number of significant figures in any derived quantity (the resistance in the example above)  
should be equal to the smallest number of significant figures in the data. If your measurements  
permit, you may also give one more figure than this. In the example above, the resistance could be  
given to three or four significant figures.  
In most practical examinations you will be required to draw a graph to represent the data you have  
collected. Make sure before the examination that you have a sharp pencil and a long, clear plastic  
ruler to draw the graph. You should be thoroughly familiar with the details about drawing graphs, in  
the section on analysing results in Chapter P1 of the coursebook. To summarise:  
■■ each axis must be labelled with the appropriate quantity and unit  
■■ the plotted points should occupy at least half the grid in both the x and y directions  
■■ the x-axis scale should increase positively to the right  
■■ the y-axis scale should increase positively upwards  
■■ the scale should have 1, 2 or 5 units to a 2 cm square  
■■ all plotted points should appear on the grid itself and none should be outside of it  
■■ check that your points are plotted accurately  
■■ when drawing a line of best fit, make sure there is a balance of points on either side of the line  
along all of its length  
■■ when finding a gradient, draw a triangle that covers more than half of the actual graph line  
■■ show all your working when calculating a gradient  
■■ if you are asked for an intercept, you can read it from the graph; if this is not possible, you can  
take the equation of the straight line and a point on the line to calculate the intercept.  
A practical examination will also ask you to calculate uncertainties and suggest improvements. It is  
important that these improvements relate to the actual experiment and are possible to carry out,  
although you will not have to alter the apparatus yourself or take further readings.

Written examination of practical skills  
The best preparation for a written examination of practical skills is to have practised the skills you  
need to answer the examination questions on many occasions, by:  
■■ planning a number of experiments yourself  
■■ taking readings according to your own plan  
■■ evaluating the results.  
It may help for you to swap plans with a fellow student and for each to try to follow the other’s plan.  
You will see how difficult it is to describe in detail what is to be done.  
As the examination time draws closer, practise by, for example, looking at past papers and their  
mark schemes under the supervision of your teacher. Remember, you need to have developed and  
practised the skills you need in ‘real’ experiments. You need the ability to think for yourself, to know  
what apparatus is available in a physics laboratory and to know how it is used, so that you can take  
the correct approach to the questions in the exam paper.  
There are three main types of question you will face in an examination of this type.  
1 Planning question  
First read the question through several times and identify the dependent and independent variables.  
You may have to consider a number of other issues, which may involve:  
■■ choosing what apparatus you will use to solve the problem set in the question  
■■ describing the experimental arrangement  
■■ describing a sequence of instructions to take the readings  
■■ stating and describing how you will keep other variables constant (remember to include  
sufficient detail)  
■■ describing how the data is processed, often in the form of a graph (remember to state the axes  
on the graph and the form you expect the graph to take; if you sketch the graph, make sure the  
sketch is consistent with your description)  
■■ describing relevant safety precautions; give detail and reasons; do not just say, for example, ‘do  
not touch the resistor’ but explain that the resistor may be hot.  
The question will suggest a structure, and it is sensible to make sure that your answer follows  
this structure and includes as much detail as you can about each point as you go along. Marks for  
additional detail are likely to be offered, so you should answer each section with a wealth of detail  
and supporting material. For example, you could suggest how additional variables are kept constant,  
give circuit diagrams or describe additional safety precautions.  
The diagram of your apparatus is important:  
■■ it should be labelled with as much detail as you can provide  
■■ you should check that it is possible to take the measurements and alter the independent variable  
with the actual apparatus that you draw  
■■ you should re-check your diagram, imagining that you are another person who is not familiar with  
the experiment – could they actually take the necessary readings for the experiment?  
2 Analysis and evaluation question  
Refresh your memory on the important points in the practical examination paper section guidance  
above concerning significant figures, graphs, gradients and intercepts; they also apply to a written  
examination of practical skills.  
You should also practise using expressions that involve the exponential function and rearranging  
them to plot an appropriate graph. More help is given on this topic in Chapter P2 of the coursebook.

Remember that the unit for a logarithmic quantity is written slightly strangely, for example  
ln (d / cm). The logarithm itself does not have a unit.  
You will need plenty of practice in using calculated uncertainties to draw error bars and in using  
these error bars to draw a ‘worst acceptable’ line as well as a line of best fit. You should draw your  
‘worst acceptable’ line as a broken line or, preferably, clearly label each line as ‘best-fit line’ or ‘worst  
acceptable line’.  
The skills of data analysis involved in this question are ones that you can practise again and again,  
for example by using past papers, until you are sure that you can:  
■■ complete tables of results using the right headings  
■■ rearrange equations such as: y = mx + c, y = axn and y = aekx  
■■ plot ordinary and log graphs, knowing how logarithms are taken of each side in the  
above equations  
■■ show error bars on graphs  
■■ calculate gradients  
■■ use the correct number of significant figures  
■■ draw curved trend lines and tangents when required to do so  
■■ write sensible conclusions.  
If you practise using past papers, ask your teacher for the mark scheme or sample answers, or swap  
with a friend and discuss your answers, to make sure that you have understood all of the points. If  
you do this, then the examination itself will not be a great surprise and you will show that you have  
the determination to succeed.  
Finally  
Some questions in examination papers are likely to seem strange, and you may be unsure of the  
answer. There is no need to panic, as this is likely to be the same for every student. If you are in  
doubt, first make sure that you have understood the question, and then make sure that you are  
describing when the question says ‘describe’ or applying physics principles when the question  
says ‘explain’. Try to think carefully to yourself about what physics principle is actually involved,  
and perhaps roughly plan your approach before starting to write the answer. Avoid repeating the  
question or writing out pages from your notes or from the coursebook, but make it your aim to relate  
the principle to the question itself. An examination is trying to discover what you really know and  
can do. If all has gone well during your course and when using the coursebook, you will have ensured  
that you not only understand these principles but can apply them to a range of questions. If that is  
the case, then you can be confident of giving a good performance.  
The questions, example answers, marks and comments that appear in the Coursebook and this  
accompanying CD-ROM were written by the authors. In examination, the way in which marks would be  
awarded to answers may be different.

Introduction to the examination and  
changes to the syllabus  
The Cambridge International Examinations Physics  
examination – a student’s perspective  
You should find out from your teacher which examination you will take and when. The following  
details refer to the latest syllabus, but it is important that you refer to the syllabus for the year in  
which you are taking the examination, in case details change.  
If you are entered for the Advanced Subsidiary (AS) Physics examination, then you will take three  
papers, Papers 1, 2 and 3, in a single examination series in either June or November, or in March for  
candidates in India.  
After your AS level examination, you may, if you wish, continue to study physics and then take the  
full Advanced Level Physics qualification. If you do this, your AS level marks in Papers 1, 2 and 3 are  
carried forward and you take two more papers, Papers 4 and 5, in a single session. Your final grade  
for the full A level is based on all of the papers you have taken, Papers 1 to 5.  
However, you may take the complete Advanced Level Physics qualification in a single examination  
series. In this case you take all the five papers in one single session. This may not be as hard as you  
think, as some of the questions in Papers 4 and 5 rely on material taught for the previous papers and  
you will be much more experienced when answering Papers 1, 2 and 3 if you take them later. On the  
other hand, there are fewer papers to take in any single series if you take the AS level examination  
before the final two papers.  
The coursebook is divided into two sections to help you prepare for the AS level and the full A level  
separately, but you will need to know all the material from the AS level when you take Papers 4 and 5.

Changes for the 2016 syllabus  
You should make sure that you use the correct syllabus for the session that you are taking the  
examination. You will find the syllabus on the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) website at  
www.cie.org.uk, or you should ask your teacher.  
For 2016 examinations, there were a number of changes made to the syllabus. It may be important  
that you know about these changes.  
Changes to the examinations  
The main change to the examinations themselves is that in Paper 4 there is now only one section. For  
examinations taken before 2016, Paper 4 contained two sections, with section B based on applications  
of physics. Although these applications are largely still in the syllabus, they are now more closely  
related to the appropriate area of physics. For example, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is  
now part of the section on magnetic fields, rather than being in a separate applications section called  
Remote sensing. Questions on these applications may appear at any place within Paper 4.  
The second edition of the coursebook now incorporates many of these applications alongside the  
appropriate topic, rather than as a separate section.

Dots evenly spaced, then getting steadily  
1 Change in velocity Δv = (18 – 0) = 18 m s–1 closer together.  
Time taken Δt = 6.0 s  
So acceleration a = Δv = 18 = 3.0 m s–2 7 If l 1 = length of first section of interrupt card,  
Δt 6.0 t = time when first section enters light gate,

l = length of second section of interrupt card,

t = time when second section enters light gate,  
So acceleration a = Δv = –12 = –0.60 m s–2 3  
Δt 20 t = time when second section exits light gate,

v = u + at t 4 – t 3 0.35 – 0.30  
So after 1 s, v = 0.0 + (9.81 × 1) = 9.81 ≈ 9.8 m s–1 Δt = t 3 – t 1 = 0.30 – 0.0 = 0.30 s  
So acceleration a = Δv = 1.0 – 0.25 = 2.5 m s–2  
b After 3 s, v = 0.0 + (9.81 × 3) Δt 0.30

For second ticker-tape section, length  
l = 16 cm, time taken t = 5 × 0.02 = 0.10 s

so final velocity v = l 2 = 0.16 = 1.6 m s–1  
t 0.10

Sections of tape are adjacent, so time

$5 a v/ms–1$  
so acceleration a = Δv = 1.6 – 1.0 = 6.0 m s–2  
30 Δt 0.10  
9 a We know u, a and t and we want to know v,  
so we use the equation

velocity v = u + at = 0.0 + (2.0 × 10) = 20 m s–1

acceleration a = Δv = 30 = 3.0 m s–2

11 We know u, a and s and we want to know v, b Graph is a parabola through the origin.  
so we use the equation  
v2 = u2 + 2as 80  
So final velocity v = u2 + 2as  
70  
= (8.0)2 + 2 × 1.0 × 18 = 100 = 10 m s–1  
60  
12 We know u, v and a and we want to know s,

13 We know v, a and s and we want to know u, 20  
so we rearrange the equation v2 = u2 + 2as into

u2 = v2 – 2as, so initial speed

b Draw a tangent to the curve at point P. Read  
off two sets of values from the tangent to find

at time t = 0 s, v ≈ 60 m s–1

at time t = 12 s, v ≈ 300 m s–1

d Time taken = 2.86 s ≈ 2.9 s  
Check by rearranging , remembering that  
u = 0, so that time t = 2.86 s ≈ 2.9 s  
17 a We know s and a, and that u = 0, and we need  
to find t.

b We know s and a, and that u = 0, and we need

Substitute these values into the equation for

c This object is not falling on the Earth,  
perhaps on the Moon.  
20 Drop an object towards the sensor, but take  
care not to break it. A better method is to  
use a sloping ramp with a trolley; gradually  
increase the angle of slope. Deduce the value  
of the acceleration when the ramp is vertical.

d F = 77.3 N ≈ 77 N; F = 20.7 N ≈ 21 N x y  
22 The stone’s displacement now is s = –25 m.  
Substituting in s = ut + 1 at2 gives  
2  
–25 = 20t + 1 × (–9.81) × t2  
2  
So 4.9t2 – 20t – 25 = 0 or approximately  
5t2 – 20t – 25 = 0, which can be simplified to  
t2 – 4t – 5 = (t – 5)(t + 1) = 0.  
So time taken to reach the foot of the cliff  
= 5 s (i.e. 1 s more). Accurate answer is 5.08  
≈ 5.1 s.  
In solving the quadratic equation, you  
will have found a second solution, t = –1 s.  
Obviously, the stone could not take a negative  
time to reach the foot of the cliff. However,  
this solution does have a meaning: it tells us  
that, if the stone had been thrown upwards  
from the foot of the cliff at the correct speed, it  
would have been travelling upwards at 20 m s–1  
as it passed the top of the cliff at t = 0 s.

distance s = ut + 1 at2 = 6.1 × 0.52 + 0  
2  
= 3.21 ≈ 3.2 m  
26 First calculate the time taken for the  
projectile to return to the ground.  
Initial vertical velocity,  
u = 40 × sin45° = 28.3 m s–1  
ver  
We know the vertical distance travelled when  
the projectile hits the ground = 0 m.  
So rearrange s = ut + 1 at2 to find t.  
2  
0 = 28.3t + 1 × 9.81t2 = 28.3t + 4.905t2  
2  
So t = 0 (when the projectile is launched)  
or t = 5.77 s (when it returns to the ground).  
Assume horizontal velocity is constant,  
u = 40 × cos45° = 28.3 m s–1  
hor  
So horizontal distance  
s = ut = 28.3 × 5.77 = 163 m ≈ 160 m

1 Kirchhoff’s first law means that If the batteries are connected back to front,  
I + 3.0 A = 7.5 A, so I = 7.5 – 3.0 = 4.5 A the charge gains energy in one cell but loses  
it in the other, so total e.m.f. = 0 V.  
2 Current flowing into P equals current flowing In parallel, half the charge flows through one  
out of P, so if current in wire X is I, then battery and half through the other, so the

By calculation, rearrange d sin θ = nλ so  
sin θ = nλ = 2 × 546 × 10–9 = 0.328  
d 3.33 × 10–6  
so θ = 19.1°, but the student will measure 19°.  
c For the double-slit experiment, a measured  
width of 9 mm for ten fringes will give a  
wavelength of 562 nm. For the diffraction  
grating experiment, the measured second-  
order angle of 19° will give 543 nm. Hence the  
diffraction grating method is more accurate.  
In practice, it is also much more precise  
because the fringes are bright and sharp  
(well-defined).

10 At higher temperatures, the rate of energy  
loss to the surroundings is greater, therefore  
the temperature rise is slower.  
11 Systematic – it can (theoretically) be  
removed by perfect insulation.  
12 Mass of water used,  
m = mass of (beaker + water) – mass of beaker  
= 0.672 – 0.150 = 0.522 kg  
Power of heater, P = VI = 11.4 × 3.9 = 44.5 W  
So in 13.0 min, energy supplied by heater  
= P × t = 44.5 × 13.0 × 60 = 34.7 kJ  
Temperature rise, Δθ = 30.2 – 18.5 = 11.7 K  
So, from this experiment, the heat capacity of  
water is  
c = E = 34 700 × 11.7 = 5680 ≈ 5700 J kg–1 K–1  
mΔθ 0.522  
The biggest source of error will be energy loss  
due to poor insulation. There will also be an  
error because we have ignored the specific  
heat capacity of the beaker.  
13 a AB: solid. BC: solid + liquid. CD: liquid.  
b Internal energy increases in all three sections.  
c The specific heat capacity is greater when  
it is a solid. The gradient is greater when  
it is a liquid, so it takes less time to raise  
the temperature by the same amount, and  
therefore less energy.  
14 Energy needed to change ice into water is  
E = mL = 0.0020 × 330 000 = 660 J. When a  
solid melts, only about one bond per atom  
or molecule is broken. On boiling, several  
remaining bonds are broken, requiring more  
energy.  
15 Rate of loss of mass = 2.25 g per minute  
= 0.002 25 = 3.75 × 10–5 kg s–1

1 The plum pudding model predicts that there Carbon-14 marked correctly [1]  
will be no large-angle scattering events. An 18  
α-particle is more massive than an electron 17  
and will not be deviated by an electron. [1]  
16  
The actual experiment shows a few  
15  
α-particles scattered through more than 90°.  
14  
[1]  
These α-particles must have interacted with 13  
a charged object more massive than an 12  
electron. This object, containing most of the  
11  
mass of the atom, was called the nucleus. [1]  
10  
2 The nucleus contains 38 protons and 52  
neutrons. [1]  
3 When the nucleus ejects an α-particle, it  
emits two protons and two neutrons, [1]  
so the nucleon number decreases by 4 (A – 4)  
and the proton number (atomic number)  
decreases by 2 (Z – 2). [1]  
The nucleus then ejects two  
β–  
-particles,  
formed by decay of two neutrons to protons.  
[1]  
The nucleon number (mass number) remains  
at A – 4, but the proton number now increases  
by 2, returning to Z. [2]

Further reading  
There are many accessible books available that tackle the fundamentals of quantum physics in a  
non-mathematical way. Here is a short selection.  
Hey, T. and Walters, P. (2003) The New Quantum Universe, 2nd edn. Cambridge University Press.  
The first part deals with wave–particle duality and the evidence from experiments; the book goes on  
to explore de Broglie’s matter waves and energy levels. Much of the book goes well beyond A level  
concepts, but is an informative and accessible primer for studies beyond A level.  
Al-Khalili, J. (2012) Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed. Phoenix.  
A very wordy but friendly introduction to some of the key historical theories and experiments that  
led to the development of quantum theory. Particularly useful explanations of the double-slit  
experiment and Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect. Takes in several more  
advanced concepts.  
Flynn, S. (2013) The Science Magpie. Icon Books.  
An entertaining read comprising numerous short science stories; pages 142–145, ‘The birth of the  
quantum’, explains a little of the history behind Planck’s equation.

developed and some of their uses.  
Video  
$www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbFehcC4MHc$  
Clear explanation of the origins of line emission and absorption spectra. Uses as its starting point the  
concept of a black body emitting radiation, but quickly moves on to spectral lines observed in the  
light of the Sun, and spectra more generally.  
$www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/elibrary/resource/2015/electron-diffraction-tube$  
Very clear description of the electron diffraction tube and a demonstration of it in use.
